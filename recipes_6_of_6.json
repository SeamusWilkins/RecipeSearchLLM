Set aside.\nFor the cake batter: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F; line a cupcake pan with 12 paper liners.\nSift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt and cloves in a large bowl and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer or using a hand mixer, mix the granulated sugar and vegan butter together on medium-low speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes; scrape down the bowl. Slowly mix in the soy milk, applesauce and vanilla and mix for 2 more minutes. Slowly add the flour mixture, and then fold in the vinegar.\nDivide half of the batter among the liners, sprinkle on some of the streusel and then top with the remaining batter. Top off with more of the streusel and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Bake until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely before frosting.\nFor the shortbread crust: Turn over a cupcake pan and spray the bottoms with nonstick spray.\nCombine the flour, oil, soy milk, granulated sugar, salt and vanilla if using in a medium bowl and mix together with a fork; the dough will be crumbly. Refrigerate for 20 minutes in the bowl or wrapped in plastic wrap.\nRoll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick and use a circle cutter or a coffee cup to cut out circles. Cut out a very small circle in the middle of each dough circle. Place the dough circles on the bottoms of the cupcake pan and bake for 10 minutes. Once out of the oven, sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar while still hot.\nFor the apple compote: Put the apple pieces in a medium saucepan, add the moonshine, brown sugar and vanilla and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.\nFor the cinnamon frosting: Using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, mix the vegan butter and shortening until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape down the bowl, add the vanilla and mix for 2 more minutes. Add the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon and mix until a whipped fluffy texture, another 3 to 5 minutes. Add a splash of soy milk if needed.\nFor the cherry moonshine reduction: Put the maraschino cherries with their juices in a small saucepan, add the moonshine and granulated sugar, place over medium heat and bring to a small boil. Immediately add the cornstarch and let simmer for 2 to 4 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly, about 5 minutes, and then pour the mixture through a strainer. Let cool for 15 minutes.\nTo assemble: Using an apple corer or paring knife, cut out the center of each cupcake. Put a generous amount (about 1 tablespoon) of the apple compote in each cupcake. Frost with a small amount of cinnamon frosting. Place a shortbread crust on top of the frosting on each cupcake. Where the hole is cut out, place a fondant finger or plastic novelty finger through the crust. Drizzle some cherry moonshine reduction over each.",

  "Chocolate Caramel Puffs": {

Sift onto a large piece of waxed paper and set aside until needed.\nHeat the water, 4 tablespoons butter, and 1 tablespoon sugar in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and add the sifted dry ingredients. Use a wooden spoon to stir until the mixture comes together in a ball-like shape (it should be a bit like putty at this point). Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring energetically and thoroughly incorporating each egg before adding another. Divide the dough in level tablespoons (approximately 1/2-ounce per puff) onto 2 nonstick baking sheets, 12 evenly spaced portions per sheet. Place the baking sheets on the top and center racks of the preheated oven and bake for 20 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to center halfway through the baking time (at that time also turn each sheet 180 degrees). Remove the puffs from the oven and cool to room temperature.\nMake the Chocolate Caramel Ganache: Place the chopped semisweet and unsweetened chocolate in a 4-quart bowl and set aside. Heat the heavy cream and 2 tablespoons butter in a 1 1/2 quart saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to keep the cream hot, but not simmering until needed. Combine 1/2 cup sugar and the lemon juice in a 3-quart saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar for 7 to 8 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then, light brown as it caramelizes). Remove the saucepan from the heat. Carefully pour about 1/3 of the hot cream into the caramelized sugar. Use a whisk to stir the caramel until it stops bubbling. Add the remaining cream and stir until smooth. Immediately pour the hot caramel over the chopped chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes before stirring with a whisk until very smooth. Refrigerate the ganache until just slightly firm but not hard (if the ganache is too firm, it will be difficult to pipe).\nUsing a sharp paring knife, cut each puff in half horizontally. Transfer the chilled ganache to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe about 1 heaping tablespoon (approximately 1-ounce) of ganache onto the bottom half of each puff, then place the top half of the puff onto each portion of ganache. Serve immediately, or store in a tightly sealed plastic container at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours.",

  "Smoked Goose with Wild Rice Stuffing": {
    "instructions": "To prepare the goose, it is necessary to remove the bones from the bird. First, turn the bird upside down with the back facing you. Cut out the backbone with poultry shears, be sure to cut close and not lose the underside of the breast meat attached to the back. Now, at an angle, carefully slit along both sides of the rib cage with a boning knife to remove the breast plate. Scrape away the meat as you cut. Using a towel, grab the thigh bones from inside the goose and pull the leg towards you out of the socket, leaving the meat attached to the body. Next, sever the wings at the joint as close to the body as possible. Reserve the wings and bones for the stock. Repeat the process with the other goose.\nThe geese are now boneless. Carefully slice the breast to open them up and make an even thickness. Smear the surface of each goose with 1 tablespoon of softened butter; season with salt and pepper. Set aside while preparing the stock and stuffing.\nTo prepare the goose stock, coat a large stockpot with olive oil and place over medium heat. Add the vegetables and saute for 2 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients, including all the geese bones, and cook for 1 hour.\nTo prepare the stuffing, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrot and herbs. Saute for 5 minutes then add the wine. Simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce the wine to a tight paste. Add the wild rice, rye bread, and chestnuts. Stir and season with salt and pepper. Scrape the skillet mixture into a large bowl, blend in the egg, caraway seed and 1 ladle full of goose stock; mix thoroughly until evenly moistened. Spoon a layer of stuffing evenly to the edges of each goose and roll up like a jellyroll. Tie securely with butcher?s twine.\nRub the outside of the goose roasts with butter, sage and marjoram for added flavor. Transfer the stuffed geese to a stovetop or conventional smoker and follow manufacture?s directions. Cook in a preheated 350 degree F oven for 20 to 40 minutes until juices run clear. Be careful not to overcook, as the meat would be extremely tough and dry. Let stand 10 minutes to allow the juices to settle. Cut off the twine and slice vertically to form pinwheels.\nTo prepare the sauce, coat a stockpot with Port and place over medium heat. Bring up to a simmer then stir in the spices and orange peel. Add 1/4 cup dried cherries and simmer to reduce the alcohol, about 5 minutes. Add the goose stock and continue to simmer for 15 minutes. Strain the sauce into a smaller saucepan to remove the solids. Add remaining 3/4 cup of dried cherries and serve.\nYield: 4 to 6 servings",

    "instructions": "In a 2 quart saucepan over medium heat, melt butter the stir in the flour. Stir the 2 together into a paste. Whisk in the milk to create what the French call a bechamel sauce. Drop the temperature a little and simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes so it thickens and the flour taste cooks out. After that it's easy, just fold in the crumbled feta, scallions, and parsley. Season it with salt and a little cracked pepper.\nOnce the cheese melts it is officially fondue, you can either use a fondue pot with a candle or just leave it in the pot and have everyone eat from there.\nFinish it with the walnuts tossed on top.

Using tongs, grill until the meatballs are browned evenly on all sides and cooked to medium, 8 to 10 minutes total, depending on the grill temperature. Move any meatballs to a cooler area of the grill if they threaten to overbrown. Transfer to a platter or a clean baking sheet as they are finished. Let rest for 5 minutes while you assemble the sandwiches.\nCut the baguette crosswise into 4 pieces and split each piece horizontally. Lay the pieces, cut side down, on the grill.

They should be cooked until they are nicely browned, but not charred, cooked through but still hold their texture. The peppers will have black marks on the outside, but they are eaten with their skin and bright color intact. Grill the mushroom stem side down first, so when it is turned and finishes cooking, the juices will be retained. Reduce the heat to medium high and grill the onion, turning and rotating as described, until tender and browned but not burned. Here are the approximate cooking times, which will vary with your grill: Peppers - 6 to 7 minutes per side Zucchini and squash - 2 to 3 minutes on first side, 2 minutes on second Eggplant - 4 to 6 minutes per side Red Onion - 3 to 4 minutes per side Portobello - 5 to 6 minutes per side As the vegetables are cooked, transfer them to plates or a large baking sheet lined with wax paper. Transfer the portobello to a cutting board and let cool for at least 5 minutes; then slice. Be sure to reserve any mushroom juices. Season the grilled vegetables and mushroom lightly with salt and pepper.\nLine a large round or oval serving platter with the arugula. Arrange the grilled vegetables decoratively in bunches around the edge of the platter. Pile up the pepper wedges in the center.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar and lemon juice with the remaining Garlic Rosemary Oil. Mix in any reserved mushroom juices. Drizzle evenly over the salad. Crumble goat cheese on top. Serve at room temperature.\nCombine all the ingredients in a small glass jar with a lid. Let stand at room temperature at least 15 minutes, preferably 1 hour. If not using within several hours, cover and refrigerate for up to a week.;",

  "Sugar Cage GT with Jacques Torres": {
    "instructions": "Place sugar, corn syrup, and 1/2 cup water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Insert a candy thermometer, and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 310 degrees to 320 degrees, what is known as the hard-crack stage. Remove pan from the heat, and carefully pour into a medium-size microwaveable glass bowl. If you leave the sugar in the pan, the sugar will continue to cook and will turn dark brown. (The sugar will stay liquid enough to work with easily for about 10 minutes; after that it will start to thicken. If this happens before you are finished, just pop the bowl in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes, until the sugar is liquid enough to work with once again.) Wash, dry, and lightly but thoroughly spray a clean, dry 5-quart bowl with cooking spray. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the inside of the bowl, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly on the side and bottom of the bowl, making sure the sugar reaches all the way to the rim of the bowl. When finished, you should still be able to see the bowl through the sugar. Use a sharp chef's knife to trim the edge of the cage clean by scraping the blade of the knife along the rim of the bowl. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes. To unmold the cage, place your thumbs on the outside of the bowl and your fingers on the inside of the sugar cage. Gently pull the cage loose from the side and bottom of the bowl. Once the cage has been released from the bowl, carefully lift it out and place it over a dessert. If the sugar is still too warm, the cage may begin to collapse. Repeat with remaining sugar to form 3 more cages. At this stage, the cages can be stored, right side up, in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for 1 to 2 days.;",

  "New Zealand Venison Sliders with Tomato Chile Jam": {

Do not overcook! This lovely lean meat is best served rare or medium-rare.\nPlace the grilled venison sliders on a bun, top with Tomato Chile Jam and cover with the bun top. Finish by skewering a cornichon and driving the skewer through the top bun, the slider and the bottom bun to keep them intact and easy to eat. Repeat with all the sliders.\nPlace the sliders on a platter and waste no time getting them to your guests and into your mouth!\nCombine the tomatoes, sugar, vinegar, fish sauce, garlic, chiles and ginger in a saucepot. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook for about 2 hours, stirring all the time to make sure it doesn't scorch on the bottom. Allow the thick, glossy condiment to cool to room temperature, and refrigerate till needed.

  "Sicilian Ricotta Tart": {
    "instructions": "For the Tart Dough: This recipe works best with very cold butter. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch cubes. Since butter softens rapidly with handling, return the cubes to the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes while you set up the food processor and gather the dry ingredients. Place the flour, sugar, and kosher salt, in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse on/off a few times to combine. Add the butter, tossing quickly with a spatula to coat each cube with flour. This prevents the butter cubes from adhering together and helps them to break apart and combine more evenly with the flour. Pulse on and off 15 times until the butter particles are the size of small peas. With the motor running, add the ice water all at once through the feed tube. Process for about 10 seconds, stopping the machine before the dough becomes a solid mass. Turn the contents of the bowl onto a sheet of aluminum foil, pressing any loose particles into the mass of dough. Roughly form the dough into a 7-inch disk. Cover the dough completely with aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until ready to use. The dough may be refrigerated up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 weeks. Let dough rest in refrigerator until needed.\nFor the Tart: Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll out each portion of dough on a floured surface into 9-inch free form circles, about 3/8-inch thick, and transfer to baking sheets. Cover and chill the dough while you prepare the filling.

  "Wild Mushroom and Fonduta Ravioli with Asparagus, Butter and Parmigiano": {
    "instructions": "For the Fresh Pasta Dough: Place the flour on a work surface. Make a well in the center and add the eggs, olive oil and salt. Begin mixing the eggs with a fork, being careful to stay in the center. Add flour from the sides of the well little by little. When it becomes too stiff to mix with a fork, continue, incorporating flour by gently kneading the dough.\nWhen the dough has absorbed about as much flour as it's going to, move it to another area of the counter, scrape up the remaining flour and pass it through a sifter to remove any dried bits (you don't want these in your dough.)\nThen start kneading, keeping the table lightly dusted with flour. When it no longer sticks to the table, you're about finished. In the end, you want a smooth, firm but resilient, homogenous ball of dough, neither too dry nor too soft. Poke the dough and it should spring right back, press your fingers into the middle of the ball and it should feel just a bit tacky. If it is very sticky, you'll need to add more flour.\nWrap the dough loosely in plastic and let it rest for at least 1 hour. This will make it easier to roll out.\nFor the Mushroom Filling: Heat the oil in a frying pan add the mushrooms and saute. Add the garlic and deglaze with the white wine.\nWhen the wine has cooked away, add the mushroom stock and simmer until almost all the liquid has evaporated.\nLet the mushrooms cool then pulse in a food processor until coarsely chopped. In a mixing bowl, fold in the herbs and season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also stir in a drop of truffle oil if desired.\nFor the Porcini Mushroom Stock: Place porcini in a saucepot and cover with water. Bring to a boil then lower heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the mushroom steep for 30 to 40 minutes.\nPass the stock through a strainer lined with a cheesecloth or a dampened paper towel to remove the mushrooms and any bits of sand.\nYou should have 4 cups of flavorful, not overly concentrated, stock.\nFor the Fonduta: Trim the red rind off the cheese and chop in a food processor. Put the cheese in a stainless steel mixing bowl, pour the milk over the cheese, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate over night. Fill a saucepan halfway with water and bring to boil. Place the mixing bowl over the pot to create a double boiler and allow the cheese to dissolve slowly into the milk, whisking occasionally.\nWhen the milk and cheese are completely amalgamated, stir in the flour. Whisk in the egg yolks one at a time. When all the eggs have been incorporated continue whisking over the heat until the mixture is thick and creamy and warm to the touch. Be careful not to let the fonduta get to hot or it will curdle.\nFor the Ravioli: Using a pasta rolling machine or rolling pin, roll pasta out into a very thin sheet 6 to 8 inches wide. Spoon the mushroom filling on to half of the sheet in 2 rows of even rounds. Make a small indentation in the center of each mound and, with a pastry bag or small spoon, place a little of the fonduta into the center of each mound. Brush a little of the egg yolk around the mushroom filling then carefully lay the other half of the pasta sheet over the top. Gently press around the filling. Using a scalloped pastry wheel, cut the pasta in between the mounds to form individual ravioli. Keep the ravioli on a board or pan sprinkled with flour until ready to cook. (May be made and kept in refrigerator up to a day in advance). Bring a pot of salted water to a boil add the ravioli and cook 3 to 5 minutes; when the pasta rises to the surface they are done. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the asparagus, a pinch of salt. Add the ravioli, toss with the Parmigiano cheese and serve.",

  "Grilled Soy and Ginger Marinated Rack of Lamb Served with Hunan Style Eggplant and Miso and Plum Sauce": {
    "instructions": "To make the Soy and Ginger Marinade: in a bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir until well blended.\nFor the lamb: Wrap the chop bones with aluminum foil. (This will minimize the exposure of bones to the marinade and prevent the bones from turning black during the grilling process.) Marinate the racks of lamb for 1 hour in the refrigerator.\nPreheat the grill. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nOver high heat, grill the racks of lamb until nicely marked and golden brown in color. Remove the aluminum foil covering the lamb bones. Transfer to a preheated oven to finish cooking to medium rare or desired doneness.\nCut each rack of lamb into 4 double chop pieces. Serve on a bed of Hunan Style Eggplant, with half the Miso and Plum Sauce drizzled over with Cilantro and Mint Vinaigrette. Garnish with julienne green onions and sprigs of cilantro.\nIn a small saucepan, bring water to a boil. Blanch the garlic slices for 30 seconds. Drain. Transfer to a baking tray and allow to cool.\nPreheat the oil in a deep-fryer to 360 degrees F.\nIn a small bowl, combine the 3 types of soy sauces. Reserve. In a wok or large saute pan, over high heat, add the peanut oil. Stir-fry the blanched garlic until golden brown. Add the sugar and continue to stir-fry until garlic is well coated. Add the chili paste. Deglaze with rice wine and vinegar. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Reduce until slightly thickened. Stir in the soy sauce mixture and continue to simmer for another 2 minutes.\nCombine the cornstarch and the water in a small bowl to make a slurry. Stir in the slurry and boil the sauce for 2 to 3 minutes, whisking all the while, to prevent scorching. Add some water if sauce is too thick. Lower to a simmer.\nDeep-fry the eggplant until tender and golden in color. Drain off excess oil. Bring sauce back to a boil and stir in fried eggplant. Lower heat to a simmer and allow sauce to reduce and thicken. Serve immediately.\nYield: 8 servings\nIn a medium saucepan, heat the peanut oil. Over medium heat, add the garlic, shallots, ginger and green onions and saute until glossy and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in star anise and black peppercorns. Continue to saute until aromatic, about 1 to 2 minutes.\nDeglaze with the plum, port and red wines. Reduce until only about 1 cup of liquid remains. Add the lamb demi-glace and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and lower to a simmer. Continue to simmer until slightly thickened. Stir in the raspberry puree, red miso paste and neriume. Continue to reduce until glossy.\nStir in the butter. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. If too tart, add a pinch of sugar. Strain through a chinois and keep warm until needed.\nIn a small bowl combine the mustard powder and the water and stir to make a paste and set aside. In a blender, combine the cilantro, mint, egg yolk, peanuts, cashews, lemon juice, pickled ginger, vinegar, and reconstituted mustard. Process to a puree. While the motor is running, slowly add the peanut oil until emulsified. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and sugar. Refrigerate until needed. Use half of the vinaigrette for the lamb and reserve half for the salmon.\n*RAW EGG WARNING\nFood Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness. To reduce this risk, we recommend you use only fresh, properly-refrigerated, clean, grade A or AA eggs with intact shells, and avoid contact between the yolks or whites and the shell.\nYield: about 1 1/2 cups vinaigrette",

Heat fat until hot in a 10-inch nonstick skillet, over medium high heat. Add potatoes, shaking the pan and turning them to cover evenly with fat. Once a few slices begin to brown, press potatoes with a spatula to flatten into a disk. Adjust heat to medium low, cover tightly, and cook until several slices are golden brown on the bottom, about 5 to 7 minutes. Carefully lift off cover so condensation does not fall on potatoes, and wipe dry. Mix cooked slices into other potatoes and than add shaved truffles, if desired. Replace cover, and cook until bottom of galette is golden brown, about 5 minutes longer. Shake galette onto a plate, cover with a second plate of the same size, invert then slide galette back into pan. Do not worry if some slices need rearranging. Flatten potatoes again, and cover. Cook 10 to 12 minutes longer, removing lid after 5 minutes, or until potatoes are golden brown, turning heat up slightly if needed to color potatoes. Turn galette again, if necessary, and cook uncovered for a few minutes longer, or until golden brown. Galette may be loosely tented with aluminum foil and kept warm in the oven or on top of the stove. Slide galette onto a flat plate. Season with salt and pepper. Combine parsley with garlic, and sprinkle over potatoes. Cut into 8 wedges and serve. Yield: 8 servings\nFor the duck, score the skin. Season both sides of duck breasts with salt and pepper. Heat 2 heavy skillets until medium hot, over medium high heat. Put duck breasts in pans, skin side down, without any butter or fat. Cook for 8 minutes, checking to avoid burning. Remove fat as it accumulates. Flip breasts over, lower heat to medium and cook 4 minutes longer. Remove duck from heat and keep warm in one of the skillets. Meanwhile, heat the port wine in a saucepan to a boil. Add the diced plums and 2 tablespoons of demi-glace and simmer, partially covered, until the plums are cooked and tender (10 to15 minutes.)

Slowly add the boiling water in 1/4 cup increments, mixing with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is no longer too hot to handle. All the water may not be needed. Knead the dough on a floured work surface until it becomes smooth and elastic, 15 to 20 minutes. Form the dough into a ball, return it to the bowl, and cover it with a damp cloth. Allow the dough to rest for 1 hour. To form the wrappers, add more flour to the work surface. Divide the dough in half. Shape 1 portion into a log and roll it back and forth under your palms to make a thin sausage shape measuring about 1-inch in diameter. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces. One by one, stand each piece on end, flatten the piece with your palm, and rollout to form a circular wrapper about 3 inches in diameter and 1/16-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining dough. To fill the dumplings, place about 1/2 teaspoon of the filling in the center of each wrapper. Avoid getting filling on the edges of the wrapper, which would prevent proper sealing. Place another wrapper on top pressing down around filling to remove excess air. Crimp the edges together. Continue with remaining filling and wrappers.\nFor the filling: In a food processor, puree the chicken until smooth then add the goose liver, foie gras and egg and puree until smooth again.

  "Grilled BBQ Short Ribs": {
    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nSpecial equipment: a pressure cooker (see Cook's Note)\nSeason the short ribs with 1 teaspoon each of the salt and black pepper. Heat the oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat. When hot, add the short ribs and sear on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the pressure cooker and reserve.\nLower the heat to medium, add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, sage and thyme and cook until lightly caramelized, 6 to 8 minutes. There should be a fond-- tasty bits from searing the ribs--on the bottom of the pan. Add the red wine and chicken stock and, using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pressure cooker to get the fond into the sauce. Let the wine reduce for 6 minutes. Add the short ribs back to the pressure cooker and stir well. Add the pressure cooker lid, line up the arrows and, following the manufacturer's instructions, keep over medium heat while the cooker pressurizes. Cook over medium heat until the ribs are tender and almost falling off the bone, 45 minutes. Remove the pressure cooker from the heat and carefully release the steam through the pressure valve on the lid, following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the ribs to a plate. Reserve to the side.\nStrain the cooking liquid from the pressure cooker into a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until reduced by half, about 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a separate saute pan, combine the red wine vinegar, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, hot sauce, red pepper flakes, remaining teaspoons each of salt and black pepper and whisk together well. Bring the sauce to a simmer. Add 1 cup of the reduced cooking liquid to the barbecue sauce mixture and cook until thickened, another 5 minutes.\nPrepare a grill for medium-high heat. Place the short ribs on the grill, baste with the barbecue sauce, and cook until they have started to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Baste the short ribs with the sauce, flip the ribs, and cook until the other sides start to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the short ribs to a cutting board and allow to rest 5 minutes.\nServe the BBQ short ribs over a bed of Roasted Red Pepper Polenta; drizzle with more barbecue sauce and garnish with sliced scallions, if using. Serve immediately.\nTo fire-roast the red peppers, place them over a high flame on a stove-top burner and roast, turning occasionally, until the skins turn black on all sides. Place the peppers in a medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow them to steam for 10 minutes. Peel away the blackened skins from the peppers. Cut away the stems and then seed, core and coarsely chop the peppers. Place them in a food processor and puree until smooth; reserve to the side.\nIn a heavy bottom medium pot, bring 8 cups water, salt and the roasted red pepper puree to a boil. Add the stone-ground cornmeal in a gentle stream, whisking or stirring vigorously in the same direction as you pour it in. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring continuously for 2 to 3 minutes. Cook the polenta, stirring every few minutes and scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent from sticking for 35 to 40 minutes. When the polenta is thick, glossy and pulling away from the side of the pan, add the Pecorino Romano and butter, stirring quickly to incorporate. Pour the polenta into a medium serving dish and serve immediately.",

    "instructions": "For the fries: Rinse and cut the potatoes lengthwise into 1/4-inch-by-1/4-inch-length fingers and hold in cold water in the refrigerator for 3 hours and up to 1 day. During the soak for the potatoes, change the water out at least once. This will help remove some of the starch from the potatoes and result in a better fry.\nAfter soaking the potatoes, remove from the water and pat dry. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fryer to 300 degrees F. Pre-cook the potatoes for 3 minutes, blanching them. After blanching, return them to the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. The cooling helps to create crispier skin during the second cooking. To finish, raise the fryer temperature to 350 degrees F. Remove the fries from the refrigerator. Load the fries into the baskets no more than one-third the depth of the baskets, and cook until crisp, a final 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and allow the oil to drip off. Season with salt and pepper.\nFor the burgers: In a bowl, blend the sirloin with the salt and pepper, mixing well but do not over mix. Over mixing will result in tough burgers. Portion the meat into 6 equal balls. Next, between two 5-to-6-inch plates, with parchment paper on each plate, press the balls into 1-inch-thick patties.\nTo cook, heat a large pan over medium heat with the grapeseed oil until hot, about1 minute. After heating the oil, add the burgers, reduce the heat to medium and cook on the first side, 4 to 5 minutes. Then flip the burgers and cook, another 4 to 5 minutes. After cooking the second side, add the cheese and turn the heat off. The burgers will finish with \"carry over\" cooking, and this will allow the cheese to melt.\nDuring the carry over cooking, heat a second pan over medium heat with the butter to coat the bottom of the pan, about 1 minute. Once the butter is heated, add the buns in batches and brown. This will take 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the buns once browned and repeat the process with the remaining buns.\nTo build a burger, place a romaine leaf, tomato slice and cheesed burger on the bottom bun.

  "Cranberry Creme Caramel": {
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 315 degrees F.\nFor the caramel: Pour the sugar into a medium-size, heavy-bottomed frying pan and place over medium-high heat. Make a dry caramel by letting the sugar cook until evenly dark golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remember, the caramel will continue to cook in the oven, when baking the custard, so do not make it too dark or it will taste bitter. Occasionally stir the sugar with a wooden spoon to remove any lumps. When the caramel has reached the proper color, add water (it may splatter) to keep it from becoming too hard. Mix in the water and remove the caramel from the heat. Carefully pour the hot caramel into the bottom of a 2-quart mold. It may be necessary to tilt the mold from side to side so that the caramel completely covers the bottom.\nFor the custard: Pour the milk and 1/2 cup of the sugar into a non-reactive 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan. While the milk is heating over medium-high heat, use a sharp paring knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the bean with the knife. Place the skin and seeds in the heating milk. Scald the milk mixture by heating it until bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan. Remove from heat.\nPlace the remaining sugar, the whole eggs, and egg yolks in a large mixing bowl and whisk until well incorporated. When you add sugar to eggs (especially to egg yolks), it is important to create an emulsion quickly or else a chemical reaction that produces heat will occur. If you do not whisk immediately, this heat will cook the egg yolks and cause lumps in the custard. Continue to whisk while slowly pouring the hot milk into the egg mixture and whisking until the mixture is smooth and homogenous in color. Try not to create air bubbles on the surface of the custard when you whisk, as these can form a crust on the baked custard. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the vanilla bean pieces and any overcooked eggs. Sprinkle the cranberries into the bottom of the mold. Then, pour the milk mixture into the mold and place in a roasting pan in the oven.\nTraditionally, custard is baked in a hot water bath to insulate it from the direct heat of the oven and to keep the eggs from cooking too fast, which would cause them to separate. Use hot water from the tap and pour enough water into the roasting pan to reach halfway up the side of the mold. When baked correctly, the custard should tremble slightly when gently shaken. In a conventional oven, this should take about 1 hour. If you detect any liquid under the skin, the custard is underbaked. Put it back in the oven and shake it every 5 minutes until it is ready. If the custard begins to bubble during baking, reduce the oven temperature 25 degrees F (14 degrees C).\nRemove the mold from the oven and the water bath and place on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving; it will finish setting in the refrigerator. Let the water bath cool before removing it from the oven.\nTo unmold the creme caramel: Carefully run a sharp paring knife around the inside of the mold to loosen the custard. Invert a flat plate over the creme caramel. Place 1 hand on either side, grasping both plate and mold, and flip them both so that the mold is on top. Gently lift off the mold. You may need to tap the bottom of the mold to release the custard. Sometimes I like to serve this dessert with whipped cream. Creme caramel will keep in the refrigerator, well wrapped in plastic wrap, for a couple of days.",

  "Susanna Foo's Pork Dumplings with Soy Ginger Sauce": {
    "instructions": "In a large bowl, combine the pork, scallions, soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger root. Mix well so that the flavors will penetrate the meat. Then add the cabbage and mix until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. The filling will not taste right if you try to combine all the ingredients at once. Place 1 dumpling wrapper on a plate or a board. (You can buy the wrappers in grocery stores or oriental specialty markets.) Place 1 scant tablespoon pork mixture in the center. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with a little water, then fold them over the filling to form a half moon shape. Pinch the center together first, then stand the dumpling up on its base and pleat one of the sides of the half moon twice, half way between the outer edge and the center. Pleat the other side in the same way and leave the dumpling standing up. Stand the finished dumplings on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper. Do not allow the sides of the dumplings to touch each other, or they will stick together. Repeat, using the remaining dumpling wrappers and pork filling. The dumplings can be made and frozen for up to 3 months or they may be cooked immediately, either boiled or pan fried. Serve hot.\nTip: if you cannot get napa cabbage, substitute green cabbage. You will need to add 2 tablespoons of water to the pork filling before adding the cabbage, because green cabbage is not as moist as Chinese cabbage.\nTo Pan Fry Dumplings: Heat 1 tablespoon corn oil in a large non-stick skillet. Add as many dumplings as can fit in a single layer. Pour 1/2 cup cold water over the dumplings. Cover the skillet and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, without turning or stirring, until the water has evaporated and the dumplings are golden and crisp on the bottom. If the dumplings are not browned enough, keep cooking until they are. Remove the dumplings to a heated platter and repeat with the remaining dumplings.\nTip: Defrost frozen dumplings before cooking or they will burn.\nTo Boil Dumplings: Fill a large stock pot 2/3 full of water and bring to a boil. Add 1/3 of the prepared dumplings. Using a Chinese strainer or slotted spoon, stir the dumplings to prevent them from sticking together. Return the water to a boil. The dumplings will rise to the top, but at this point the filling will still be raw. Add 1/2 cup cold water and return to a boil again. When the dumplings float, taste one to see if it's done. If not, add another 1/2 cup cold water and cook until the dumplings rise again. Adding cold water slows the cooking so the dough does not break, allowing enough time for the filling to be thoroughly cooked. Remove the dumplings from the pot using a Chinese strainer or slotted spoon and place them on a plate, being careful to keep them separate from one an\nCombine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Mix thoroughly and serve. This sauce will keep up to 1 week in the refrigerator, without the ginger root. Add the ginger root when ready to ser;",

Pulse until combined into fine crumbs. Cream the butter in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer) until smooth. Add the sugar-marzipan mixture and mix. Add the vanilla and mix. Add the eggs two at a time, mixing after each one. Sift the flour, baking powder, salt, and ginger together. Working in batches, add the dry ingredients to the marzipan mixture, mixing after each addition just until combined. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a tester inserted into the center comes out dry and clean (a few crumbs are okay) and let cool in the pan.\nCombine sugar and water and bring to a boil on a medium saucepan. Boil until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F. Whip egg yolks until light and fluffy and carefully pour the sugar water mixture into the yolks while the mixer is running at a moderate speed. Continue whipping until cooled. Add softened butter in small batches, stopping after each addition. Remove the 9-inch round cake from the pan, and cut a 5-inch and a 3-inch circle of cake from the 9-inch square pan. Cover them with butter cream and freeze. Dye fondant pastel pink, blue and yellow by kneading food coloring into it. Roll out on a powdered sugared surface and cut 1 circle out of each color to cover 1 layer of the cake, leaving 2 extra inches to hang over sides. Lay the fondant over the cake layers and with your hands, mold the fondant over the cake to fit. Trim the edge and tuck it slightly under the cake. On a large cake platter, stack the layers and run a long skewer down the center.\nWhip together powdered sugar and 3 to 4 tablespoons of the egg whites so it's pipe-able but not too thin that it runs on the cake.

  "Cracked Black Pepper Pasta": {
    "instructions": "Clean and dry a few coat hangers to dry the pasta on.\nInto the bowl of a food processor, add the flour, eggs, oil, and black pepper. Process until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Put the mixture onto your work surface and knead it lightly for a few minutes until it is smooth. It should be quite stiff. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.\nTo make in a pasta machine: Take a quarter of the pasta and pat it into a flat rectangle with your hands. Feed it through the widest setting on the pasta machine. Fold that piece in thirds into a rectangle shape and feed it through again. After you have fed it through on the initial setting, there is no need to keep folding it, just keep feeding it through, making the setting narrower each time.\nIf the pasta rips while using the pasta machine, don't worry, just fold it back into a rectangle and feed it through the widest setting again. A rip may mean that there is an obstruction in the pasta machine between the rollers. If that is the case, just open the machine to the widest setting and let whatever was stuck in there fall out.\nIf the pasta sticks to the machine, just flour the machine a little to help ease the pasta through.\nWhen you have fed the pasta through on the narrowest setting, sprinkle the top with a little flour and fold it in half, short end to short end, then again, and again and again until you have a smaller rectangle. With the folded edge facing you, cut vertical strips about 1/2-inch wide along the width of the pasta, then carefully take one strip, unfold it completely and hang it on the coat hanger.\nRepeat with the rest of the pasta, using a quarter piece of the dough each time.\nTo make the pasta by hand: Dust the work surface very lightly with flour. Take a quarter of the dough and put it on the work surface. Pat the dough with your hands into a flat rectangle. Lightly flour a rolling pin and roll it out until it is a very long and thin rectangle.\nMy rectangle was 5 to 6 inches wide and very, very long. The pasta is ready when it is so thin that if you lift it up and put your hand behind it, you can see your hand through it.\nSprinkle the top with a little flour and fold it in half, short end to short end, then again, and again and again until you have a smaller rectangle. With the folded edge facing you, cut vertical strips about 1/2-inch wide along the width of the pasta, then carefully take one strip, unfold it completely and hang it on the coat hanger.\nRepeat with the rest of the pasta, using a quarter piece of the dough each time.\nOnce all of the pasta is hung, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta, in one or two batches depending on how big your pan is, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the pasta is just cooked through. Using a pair of tongs, remove the pasta from the pan and, drain in a colander. If cooking the pasta in batches keep the first batch warm while cooking the rest.\nOnce all the pasta is cooked and drained, drizzle with some of the olive oil, sprinkle a few basil leaves over the top and serve immediately.\nThis is delicious used in the Creamy Pancetta Sauce with Mushrooms and Parmesan.",

  "Brioche Doughnut": {
    "instructions": "Special equipment: doughnut cutter\nTo make the brioche doughnuts: Put the warm milk in a mixing bowl (an electric mixer works best for this recipe--so if you have one put the milk in the mixer bowl). Sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk and allow it to dissolve. Whisk 1 egg and 1 cup of the flour into the yeast mixture. When the dough-sponge is smooth, sprinkle it with an additional cup of flour. Allow the dough-sponge to rise in a warm place until the top layer of flour cracks, about 30 minutes.\nLightly beat the 4 remaining eggs. Then, using the dough hook attachment of an electric mixer set at medium speed, or a wooden spoon, work the eggs into the dough. When the dough is smooth, add the sugar, salt, and remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour all at once. If using a mixer, start on low and gradually increase the speed as the dough comes together, mixing for a good 15 to 20 minutes. If you do not have a mixer turn the dough out onto a clean, floured work surface and knead until it is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky. (Don't be alarmed if the dough seems too wet. It will tighten up into nice, soft, elastic dough.) When the dough comes together, add the butter and mix for another 10 to 15 minutes.\nCover the dough with a clean towel and set it aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Stretch the dough to release some of the trapped gasses and redistribute the yeast, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured work surface. Gently stretch the dough into a rectangle, then roll it out about 3/4-inch thick. Cut the dough with a doughnut cutter. Transfer the doughnuts to a floured board or baking sheet. Cover the doughnuts with a clean towel and allow them to rise in a warm place until they feel soft and fluffy, about 1 hour.\nTo make the crazy glaze: Beat the egg whites until frothy. Add the vanilla and confectioners' sugar and beat until smooth. Divide the glaze between several bowls then color with drops of food coloring.\nTo fry the doughnuts: Heat 2 to 3-inches of oil in a heavy, high-sided pot over medium heat until the oil reaches 350 degrees F. Working in batches of 3 or so, drop the doughnuts into the oil and fry until they float. Turn the doughnuts over in the oil and continue cooking. Cook the doughnuts, turning them once or twice more as necessary, until they are uniformly browned, then transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.\nWhile the doughnuts are still warm, dip 1 side of each into the desired color of glaze then set aside on a wire rack until the glaze is firm. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

  "Sugar Stained Glass": {
    "instructions": "Special equipment: Heavy cotton gloves, to help protect hands fromheat\nPlace the sugar for the frame in a pan, insert a candy thermometer and begin to cook the sugar. It is ready when it reaches 320 degrees F. Have the line drawing ready and enlarged to the size you need. Have 4 heatproof spouted measuring cups in a warm oven, ready for your stained glass sugar.\nArrange 4 metal rulers on a silicone baking mat in the shape of a frame the same size as your drawing. Pour the cooked frame sugar inside the frame outline so that it is about 1/4-inch thick. When the sugar has cooled, place the line drawing on the work surface and remove the sugar sheet from the ruler frame and place it over the drawing. Place some Royal Icing into a cornet and use it to trace the outlines on top of the sugar frame.\nWhen all of the outlines are drawn, place the ingredients for the stained glass in a pan, (this is your second batch of sugar) insert a candy thermometer and cook to 320 degrees F, divide the sugar evenly between the heatproof, warm measuring cups. Add a few drops of food color (pick colors that will work with your drawing) to each cup of sugar and stir with wooden skewers. It is best at this point to use some heavy cotton gloves to protect your hands. Pour 1 of the colors into a cornet and use it to fill in the spaces that you want to be that particular color. Use 1 color at a time. You can reheat the sugar in the microwave as long as it is in the measuring cups but you cannot reheat the sugar when it is in the paper cornet. When all of the spaces on your drawing have been filled to your satisfaction, you are ready to display your stained glass masterpiece!\nTo make royal icing: Combine the egg white and powdered sugar in a medium-size mixing bowl and whip with an electric mixer on medium speed until opaque and shiny, about 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and continue whipping until completely incorporated, about 3 minutes. The lemon juice whitens the royal icing. The royal icing should be light, fluffy, and slightly stiff. You may need to adjust the consistency by adding more egg whites if the icing is too dry or more powdered sugar if it is too wet.\nPlace the royal icing in a small piping bag or paper cornet.\nYield: 2 cups\nHow to Make a Cornet: From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres The Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations.\nCut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between 2 fingers of 1 hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side.\nRelease your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size.",

  "Honey Squash Pie": {
    "instructions": "Line a 9 or 10-inch pie dish with the pate brisee. Transfer to refrigerator to chill; freeze any remaining pastry. Cut the squash in half and remove the seeds. Put a rack in a saucepan, and add water to within 1 inch of the rack. Set the squash halves on the rack, cut-sides up, and bring the water to a boil. Cover the pan, and steam the squash for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it is fork-tender. If necessary, add more boiling water to the pan as it evaporates.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Remove the squash from the pan. When the flesh is cool enough to handle, scoop it out with a spoon; discard the shells. Using a food processor, blender, or food mill, or by pressing it through a metal sieve, puree the squash. You should have about 2 1/2 cups. Put the puree in a large bowl. Using a wooden spoon, beat the cinnamon, ginger, salt, honey, and molasses into it. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and cream, and blend into the squash mixture. Put the pie dish on a baking sheet, and pour in filling until it's 3/4 full. Pour the remaining filling into a small pitcher. Put the pie on the center shelf of the oven, and pour in reserved filling until full. (This method avoids the possibility of spilling the pie while you are transferring it to the oven.) Bake the pie for 10 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 325 degrees F and bake for an additional 45 minutes, or until the center of the filling is firm when the baking sheet is moved gently back and forth. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.\nPut the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor. All ingredients should be cold. Add the pieces of butter, and process for approximately 10 seconds, or just until the mixture resembles coarse meal. (To mix by hand, combine the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender or 2 table knives, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.) Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water, drop by drop, through the feed tube with the machine running (or into the bowl if mixing by hand), just until the dough holds together without being wet or sticky; do not process more than 30 seconds. Test the dough at this point by squeezing a small amount together. If it is crumbly, add a bit more water. Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Grasping the ends of the plastic wrap with your hands, press the dough into a flat circle with your fists. This makes rolling easier than if the pastry is chilled as a ball. Wrap the dough in the plastic, and chill for at least 1 hour. Lightly butter or spray with vegetable cooking spray the pie plates or tart pans you will be using. On a lightly floured board, roll out the pastry to a thickness of 1/8-inch. Place the pastry in a plate, pan or in a pastry ring that has been set on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and press it into the bottom edges and along the sides. Trim the pastry using scissors or a sharp paring knife, or by rolling a rolling pin across the top of the pan. Cutting the pastry an inch or so higher than the edge of the tart pan and tucking this overhang to the inside of the pan will give extra height and reinforcement. Crimp or decorate the edges of the pastry, if desired. Chill the pastry-lined pan until ready to use. Unbaked pastry shells can be refrigerated, wrapped in plastic, for up to 1 day; for longer storage, they can be frozen.\nYield: 2 (8 to 10-inch) tarts or single-crust pies, 1 (8 to 10-inch) double-crust pie, or 12 (2 1/2 to 3-inch) tartlets",

Do not wait until pork is already falling apart to reduce the liquid. This will produce a dry and tough product. If the pork is accidentally cooked all the way before reducing the liquid, remove the meat from liquid and reduce separately, then return the meat to the pot.\nAdjust water amount according to the newness of the rice (if the rice is newer then less water will be required). In a rice cooker, combine the water, coconut milk or coconut cream, sugar and salt and mix until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Add the drained rice, and mix thoroughly, making sure the rice is level in the cooker. Cook the rice according to the cooker instructions.\nFresh Coconut Milk: Thaw grated coconut. Remove the coconut from the bags, and add to a large bowl or cambro container. Add 3 cups water per 16-ounce bag of grated coconut. Allow to sit until the water is absorbed, about 1/2 hour. Press the coconut twice through a fine strainer, using the milk from the first pressing to moisten the coconut again, then strain for the last time.\nSmash the chiles, garlic and palm sugar in a mortar and pestle until the garlic is well ground; do this firmly but not violently. Add the shrimp, mash lightly and then add the long beans. Smash them gently, just to break them up. Add the dressing and the papaya. Combine the ingredients thoroughly without mashing the papaya. Add the tomatoes and crush to release their juices. Stir in the peanuts and combine well. Taste should be sour, salty, sweet and spicy in good balance. The texture should be crunchy and slightly pink in color. Make no more than 2 servings at a time!",

  "Stirato": {
    "instructions": "Morning: Combine the flour, water, yeast, and sourdough, if using, in a bowl, mixing together with a spatula or your hand moistened with water for about 1 minute. After the ingredients are combined, make a small indentation on the top of the dough. Add the salt to the small well you've just made in the dough, and about 1 tablespoon of water to cover it, but don't mix it in yet. Cover the bowl and let the dough sit for 20 minutes. Moisten your hands slightly and use the dough scraper to loosen the dough from the bowl. Rather than knead the dough, you're going to stretch and fold it in the bowl. Working from the edges of the dough, pull the dough out to stretch it and then fold it over toward the center. You can also squeeze the dough with your fingers to help incorporate the salt. If your hands begin to stick to the dough, moisten them again with water. Work around the dough and stretch and fold it 12 times. This action should take about 1 minute in total. Flip the dough over so the folds are underneath and the smooth side is on top. Cover the bowl and let the dough sit for another 20 minutes. Do the stretch-and-fold action for one more round. By now you'll notice that the salt is incorporated and the gluten offers noticeable tension. After folding about 12 times, turn the dough over again, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest for 20 minutes. Do the stretch-and-fold action 2 more times, at 20-minute intervals. In the final round, the dough should feel very elastic and should be glistening. If it isn't, add a few more stretch-and-fold actions but be careful not to rip the dough. Turn the dough over so the smooth side is face up. Cover the bowl and let it sit for 6 to 7 hours. The goal here is for the dough to rise until it has at least tripled in size, but has not collapsed in on itself. By the end of the rise, you might see big air bubbles on the top of the dough.\nAfternoon: Preheat the oven to 470 degrees F (245 degrees C), with your baking stone on the middle rack, 60 minutes before baking. In the lower part of the oven, or on the bottom, place a rimmed baking sheet that can hold half a cup of water. Place a piece of parchment paper roughly the size of your baking stone on an overturned and lightly floured baking sheet or a cutting board. Dust the parchment lightly with a 50/50 mixture of white flour and semolina flour or just white flour and set it aside. Flour a two-foot-square area of your counter generously with the flour/semolina mix or white flour. Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour. Using a plastic dough scraper, gently loosen the dough from the bowl and pour it out onto the counter, being careful to keep it in one piece. The outer, smooth surface will have landed on the floured surface, becoming the bottom of the dough. The top of the dough will be sticky. Dust it lightly with flour. Flour your hands and gently make a rectangle that's about 3/4 to 1 inch thick and about 10 by 16-inches, with the long side on the east-west axis, or parallel to the edge of the counter. Don't fuss over it to make it perfect or you'll compress the dough, losing the open structure of the air holes. Sprinkle a thick line of flour across the middle of the dough, moving east-west, marking where you will divide the rectangle in half lengthwise. Then sprinkle another two lines of flour through each of those portions, again moving east-west. You will cut the dough along the three lines, making four long loaves. Using a dowel, the wooden handle of a kitchen spoon, or a chopstick, press on the floured line so the pieces separate. A thick, dull tool works well because it joins the dough together at the seam. If the tool does not fully cut through the dough, use your dough scraper to finish cutting the pieces. Separate the pieces so they are not touching each other and cover them with a light towel. This second fermentation will take about 20 minutes. When the loaves are ready, they will be very light and spring back within one second when you press your finger very lightly into the dough.\nBaking: Pour 1/2 cup water into a measuring cup. Sprinkle the loaves lightly with semolina/flour. Loosen two loaves gently with the dough scraper. If you put enough flour on the counter it won't take much effort. Place your hands under the dough at either end of one loaf, then turn it upside down onto the floured parchment paper. To prevent the dough from sagging in the middle while you move the loaf, you can move your two hands closer together, slightly crimping the loaf lengthwise. The floured underside is now facing up. Do this with the second loaf, too. (If your baking stone is big enough, you might be able to place all four loaves on the parchment paper and bake them at once.) Now, here's the fun part. Lightly grab either end of the dough and gently stretch out the loaf to just under the size of your baking stone. If it resists, don't pull it-the dough will rip. Do the same with the second loaf. You can straighten out the edges by gently repositioning the loaf with your dough scraper, but don't fuss too much. Open the oven and slide the parchment paper off the cutting board or baking sheet and onto the baking stone. The loaves will bake on the parchment paper the entire time. Close the oven. Take the 1/2 cup water and pour it onto the baking sheet, being careful not to get burned by the steam. Shut the oven door. Bake for 18 to 22 minutes. Do not open the oven until at least 18 minutes into the bake. Bake until dark brown. Using a peel, or oven mitts, remove the loaves to a cooling rack, and let them stand for at least 20 minutes before eating. Repeat the baking method with the second two loaves. These loaves are best eaten within four hours. If you do not eat all the bread, the loaves can be frozen in a plastic bag. When you're ready to eat a loaf, remove it from the freezer until it defrosts and bake it for 5 minutes in a 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) oven to crisp up the crust. Once reheated, it will go stale relatively quickly.",

  "Organic Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread with Oats and Pecans": {
    "instructions": "Place the yeast and warm water in a large bowl and stir with a fork to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for about 3 minutes.\nWhisk the whole wheat flour, unbleached flour, oats, and salt together in a medium bowl.\nAdd the sponge starter, cool water, honey, molasses, and oil to the yeast mixture. Mix with your fingers for 1 to 2 minutes, just long enough to break up the sponge (the mixture should look milky and be slightly foamy). Add the flour mixture to the bowl and stir with your fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass. Don't be concerned if the dough feels very sticky at this point.\nLightly flour a work surface. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, until it becomes compact and elastic. It should be very moist but not mushy. If it feels too stiff to knead, add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have a soft, malleable dough. If it's sloppy wet and impossible to knead, add another 1/4 to 1/3 cup (1 1/4 to 1 2/3 ounces) of whole wheat flour. Shape the dough into a loose ball and let it rest, covered with plastic wrap, on the lightly floured work surface for 20 minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.)\nFlatten the dough and stretch it gently into a rectangle about an inch thick. Spread the pecans and raisins evenly over the dough. Fold the whole mass into an envelope and knead and fold it gently until the nuts are well distributed, about 2 to 3 minutes. If the dough resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading. Some of the nuts may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again after the first rise, when the dough has softened.\nShape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl, along with any loose nuts. Turn the dough to coat the top with oil, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled in volume, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. (You can also refrigerate this dough overnight and shape it and bake it the next day: Let it rise for 1 hour at room temperature, or until it looks slightly puffy but not doubled, before refrigerating. The next day, let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature before shaping it.)\nWhen the dough has doubled, loosen it from the bowl with lightly floured hands and gently pour it onto a floured work surface. Press any loose pecans into the dough and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a log. Spread the oats for topping on a flat plate or baking sheet. Use a pastry brush or a plant sprayer to lightly moisten the top of each log with water, then roll the tops of the loaves in the oats. Place each loaf seam side down in an oiled 9 by 5-inch loaf pan. Cover them with plastic wrap and allow to rise for about 2 hours, or until they have doubled in size (a finger pressed into the dough will leave an indentation).\nThirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan directly below the stone.\nWhen the loaves have doubled, place the pans on the baking stone. Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and immediately shut the door. After 1 minute, using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves quickly 6 to 8 times then shut the oven door. Repeat the misting procedure 1 minute later.\nBake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until the loaves sound slightly hollow when tipped out of the pan and tapped on the bottom. The sides and bottom of the loaf should feel firm and slightly crusty. If the tops are browned but the sides are still somewhat soft, place the loaves directly on the stone to bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer. Transfer the loaves from the pans to a rack and allow to cool completely before slicing.",

  "Big Sky Posole": {
    "instructions": "Soak the different colors of hominy in separate bowls of water overnight.\nIn a small, dry skillet over high heat, roast the cumin and coriander seeds until they toast, about 2 minutes. When cool, grind in a food mill, mortar and pestle or clean coffee grinder.\nStrain the hominy and put each color variety in its own pot, generously covering with water. Add 1-ounce of the baking soda to each pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for about 2 hours. Add more water as needed. Check hominy for tenderness; it does not have to be completely cooked as it will be cooked further in the stew. Strain and rinse the hominy.\nWhile the hominy is cooking, soak the dried chiles in hot water. When softened, remove the seeds and stems, then dice.\nIn a separate stockpot, heat the olive oil and saute the onions and garlic with the salt, black pepper, oregano, cumin and coriander until the onions are translucent. Add the diced tomatoes, tomatillos, chiles, vegetable stock and cooked hominy. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer for about 1 1/2 hours. The posole is done when the hominy is cooked through. Add the lime juice, cilantro, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.\nPosole is also delicious for breakfast, served over cornbread with a poached egg on top.\nCook's Note: You may use a combination of different kinds/colors of hominy and cook them together in 1 pot. However, the different colors will cook in slightly different times resulting in different consistencies. The blue or red hominy will break down more during cooking than the yellow or white kind. Posole, like many stews, improves with age, so cook ahead of time and reheat. It also freezes well.\nCook's Note: Native corns are available online and at most Latino markets.",

Pile the remaining sea salt over the fish, completely covering it by at least 1/2 inch all over. If the head and tail protrude from the pan, place a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum under tail and head to prevent salt from falling into your oven. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons water over the surface of the salt.\nTransfer roasting pan to oven, and bake salmon until cooked through, 45 to 60 minutes. To test if the fish is cooked, poke a metal skewer or kitchen fork through the salt and into the fish where the fish is the thickest. Pull the skewer out: If the skewer is warm to the touch, then the salmon is cooked. Transfer pan to a wire rack, and let rest until cool enough to handle.\nUsing your fingers, break off the salt crust from the top of the fish; the skin should have stuck to the salt and should peel away as you do this. If the skin does not pull away when you remove the salt, use a paring knife to gently lift the skin away from the fillet. Carefully lift the entire fish out of the pan.

  "Fudge Tartlets with Peanut Butter Ice Cream and Cabernet Caramel": {
    "instructions": "Special equipment: an ice-water bath; an ice cream machine; at least 2 mini-muffin tins, 24 cups each; nonstick cooking spray\nMake the ice cream: Heat the half-and-half and vanilla bean in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn't scorch on the bottom. When the cream mixture reaches a fast simmer (do not let it boil), turn off the heat. Set the mixture aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes.\nWhisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the hot half-and-half mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. At 160 degrees F, the mixture will give off a puff of steam. When the mixture reaches 180 degrees F, it will be thickened and creamy, like eggnog. Test it by dipping a wooden spoon into the mixture. Run your finger down the back of the spoon. If the stripe remains clear, the mixture is ready; if the edges blur, the mixture is not quite thick enough yet. When it is ready, quickly remove it from the heat.\nImmediately whisk in the peanut butter and whisk until smooth. Strain the mixture into a bowl to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Rest the bottom of the bowl in the ice bath and let the mixture cool, stirring often, for 2 hours. Freeze according to the directions of the ice cream machine.\nMake the crusts: In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour and sugar. Add the butter and mix until coarse and sandy.\nWhisk the egg yolks, cream, and vanilla together. Add to the flour mixture and mix at low speed just until combined. If the mixture seems too dry, add another teaspoon of heavy cream. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and form into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until ready to use. (The recipe can be made up to this point and keep refrigerated for up to 2 days.)\nRoll out the dough 1/8-inch thick on a lightly floured surface and cut out circles that are 2 inches larger in diameter than the mini-muffin cups.\nSpray the muffin tin well with nonstick cooking spray, then gently press the dough rounds into the cups, easing the dough completely into the cups. Smooth out the folds by pressing the dough against the sides and bottoms of the cups (the walls will become a little thicker). Use your fingers to form the rim of each tartlet into an even edge, pulling or cutting off extra bits of dough, if necessary.\nSpray the bottom-outside of another mini-muffin tin with nonstick spray and gently push it down into the tin with the dough rounds so that it \"spoons\" into the bottom cups. This will help prevent shrinkage during baking. Chill for 30 minutes.\nHeat the oven to 375 degrees F.\nKeeping the tins pressed together, turn them upside down on a sheet pan. Bake until the crusts are dry and golden but not brown, about 12 minutes. Let them cool upside down for 20 minutes, then invert the pans and carefully lift the top tin out, leaving the pastry cups in the bottom tin.\nMeanwhile, make the filling: Melt the chocolate and butter together in the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, stirring frequently. When melted, remove the mixture from the heat and whisk in the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt.\nHeat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nPour the filling into the prebaked tart shells (still in their tins) and bake for 11 to 13 minutes, until the filling is set at the edges but still a little moist in the center.\nMeanwhile, make the caramel sauce: Pour the sugar into the center of a deep saucepan. Carefully pour 1/2 cup water around the sugar, trying not to splash any sugar onto the sides of the pan. Do not stir; gently draw your finger through the center of the sugar to moisten it. Over high heat, bring the mixture to a full boil and cook without stirring, swirling the pot occasionally to even out the color, until it is amber-caramel, 10 to 20 minutes. When the mixture is done, immediately remove the pot from the heat. Use a wooden spoon to slowly stir in the red wine. Set aside.\nWhen ready to serve, arrange the tarts on serving plates. Put a dollop of the sauce on the plate on 1 side of the tart and a small scoop of the ice cream on the other side. Serve immediately.",

Stir in the chopped parsley and remove from the heat.\nFor assembling: Ladle a thin layer of sauce onto the pizza dough, and sprinkle the sliced and grated mozzarella on top. Arrange some of the broccoli rabe over the cheese. Season with salt and black pepper and bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is completely melted, about 8 minutes. Arrange the anchovies on the pizza, top with the egg and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garnish with chopped parsley and thyme.\nPour the warm water into a small bowl (if the water is too hot the yeast will die and if the water is too cold the yeast will not activate). Stir in the sugar and dry yeast to combine and let sit 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and smell very yeasty, this is what you want.\nCombine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the olive oil and yeast water. Gradually stir the flour into the liquid, using a fork. Once most of the flour has been incorporated, turn the dough out onto a smooth, clean work surface dusted with bench flour. Use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency.\nPlace the dough in a lightly oiled mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour 30 minutes. Portion the dough and stretch to the desired size.",

Add one more third of the flour, beat, then the rest of the milk, then the rest of the flour. Make sure that the flour and milk are entirely incorporated. Then stir a third of the beaten egg whites into the batter. When that is fully incorporated, gently fold in the rest of the beaten egg whites.\nUse a pastry bag to pipe the batter into the prepared molds, filling each one just under halfway. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the cakes start to turn golden and a cake tester or toothpick, when inserted, comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool entirely.\nUnwrap the foil from each cake, and use a knife to make a 2- to 3-inch cut in the bottom of each twinkie. The cut should go about halfway into each cake.

  "Mixed-Nut Butter-Crunch Candy": {
    "instructions": "Special equipment: 10 by 12-inch shallow baking sheet Parchment paper 2 additional baking sheets or trays 2 1/2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan Candy thermometer Pastry brush Long metal off-set spreading spatula Pastry scraper (nonstick coating) Mallet: Helpful to cut through stubborn spots on candy (To hit top of scraper when cutting through toffee.)\nTo set up: Butter a baking sheet (about 10 by 12) and line the sheet with of parchment paper (allow excess paper at both ends). Grease paper and set sheet aside. Reserve any remaining melted butter for later. Line two more shallow baking sheets or trays with waxed paper for holding and chilling assembled candy and set them aside. Cut each stick of butter in half and place next to work surface, along with measured salt, baking soda, vanilla and coarsely chopped macadamia nuts. Place chopped chocolate in a heat proof bowl and set aside. Place a cup of hot water next to stove and put a pastry brush in water.\nTo prepare toffee: Place a 2 1/2-quart heavy bottomed saucepan on the stove. Place water, sugar and corn syrup in the pan and stir gently to combine. Place pan over medium heat and as sugar dissolves, swirl pan gently. Let mixture come to a rolling boil and, once boiling and mixture is clear, don't stir or swirl pan anymore. If, while sugar is boiling, any sugar crystals cling to sides of pan, use moistened pastry brush to wash sides of the pan. Cook syrup until starts becoming a very light amber color. Lower heat and add butter, one half stick at a time, stirring very gently. (Only add additional butter after preceding piece has become melted and fully incorporated.) Once all the butter has been added, place candy thermometer into mixture, making sure that the bottom tip does not touch the bottom of the pan. Raise heat to medium and boil mixture until the temperature reads between 295 degrees F and 300 degrees F. Remove thermometer from pan and pan from stove and immediately stir in salt, baking soda, vanilla and macadamia nuts. (Quickly stick thermometer it warm water to aid in clean up.) Immediately, pour candy mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Brush the bottom of a long off-set metal spatula (an icing spatula is perfect) or a knife with some melted butter. Spread the candy mixture out so that it is 1/4-inch thick. Use the knife to push the sides back into a rectangular shape as the mixture cools. Let the mixture set for a few minutes.\nTo melt chocolate: While toffee firms up a bit, melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a skillet with 1-inch of hot but not simmering water (stirring constantly until smooth). Be careful not to allow any water to enter bowl of chocolate.\nTo cut candy: While candy mixture is still warm and pliable, use a buttered pastry scraper to score the candy into 1 1/2 by 2-inch rectangles. Let set further until the candy is firmer (5 minutes at room temperature). Score again through original cuts, making sure candy is in separate squares all the way through to the bottom. ( If stubborn, use your pastry scraper and mallet to knock through any sticky, tough spots. Hit the top (wooden part) of the scraper with a heavy mallet.)\nTo fully assemble candy and chill: When chocolate is firm, pour melted chocolate over top of scored candy and, using a spatula, spread it out evenly. It's okay if the chocolate runs down into grooves in candy. Scatter 2 cups of the ground toasted nuts on top of the chocolate and press them into the chocolate. Reserve the remaining 1 cup of nuts. Lift one end of the parchment paper so the first line of cut candy bends and separates from the next line. Carefully lift one piece off at a time. Sprinkle with some additional nuts to coat any exposed chocolate. Place candy on prepared baking sheets lined with waxed paper (in a single layer) and refrigerate (covered with plastic wrap) so chocolate will harden. Once set, place candy in an air-tight tin, separated in layers with waxed paper.

Brown the chicken well on both sides.\nOnce the chicken is brown on all sides, remove it from the pan and reserve. Drain the oil from the pan and return it to the heat. Coat the pan lightly with new olive oil. Add the sausage to the pan that the chicken was browned in. Brown the sausage well.\nAdd the onions and season with salt. Cook the onions over medium heat until they are translucent and very aromatic, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes.\nAdd the cherry pepper juice and wine to the pan and reduce it by half. While the wine is reducing, scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Return the chicken, skin-side up, to the pan and add the chicken stock and cherry peppers. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer for 5 more minutes; add more chicken stock if the stock has reduced too much. Stir in the oregano just before serving.\nTaste and adjust the seasoning if needed. The finished dish should be slightly soupy, spicy and delicious. Serve over the Soft Parmigiano Polenta.\nIn a medium saucepan, bring the milk, 2 cups water and the bay leaf to a boil. Season generously with salt, almost to the point of over seasoning. How do you know that you are there? TASTE IT!\nWhen it has reached a boil, slowly whisk in the polenta in small sprinkles. Once all of the polenta has been incorporated, reduce the heat to medium and immediately switch over to stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook the polenta for 5 minutes over medium, medium-low, adding water if the polenta becomes too thick to loosen it up.\nWhen the polenta is thoroughly cooked, it should look creamy and not feel gritty on your tongue. Remove it from the heat and stir in the Parmigiano and mascarpone. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve immediately, or place a sheet of plastic wrap right on the surface of the polenta to prevent a skin from forming on the top.

Remove the pans from the oven and place them on wire racks to cool for 10 minutes. Run a dinner knife around the edge of each layer and invert each onto a rack, then invert them again onto another rack to that the cakes are right side up. Allow them to cool completely, 30 minutes more.\nMeanwhile, prepare the Quick Caramel Frosting.\nPlace one cake layer, right side up, on a serving platter. Spread the top with the warm frosting. Place the second layer, right side up, on top of the first layer and frost the top and sides of the cake with clean, smooth strokes. Work quickly, as the frosting will set. (If the frosting gets too hard to work with, place the pan back over low heat for 1 minute, stirring constantly, to soften it up.) Once the frosting has set, slice and serve.\nStore this cake, covered in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, at room temperature for up to 1 week or freeze, wrapped in foil, for up to 6 months. Thaw the cake overnight on the counter before serving.\nPlace the butter and brown sugars in a medium-size heavy saucepan over medium heat. Stir and cook until the mixture comes to a boil, about 2 minutes. Add the milk, stir, and bring the mixture back to a boil, then remove the pan from the heat. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Beat with a wooden spoon until the frosting is smooth.\nUse immediately (while still warm) to frost the cake of your choice or the frosting will harden.

  "Stuffed Crust Cast-Iron Pizza with Smoked Mozzarella": {

Whisk together the water and honey. Turn the mixer to medium speed and slowly add the honey-water mixture and olive oil. The dough will come together when a ball is formed and pulls cleanly from the sides of the mixing bowl. If the dough is too wet, simply add a touch more flour until it pulls cleanly.\nGrease the inside of a large bowl or deep container with cooking spray. Add the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a warm area until the dough doubles in size, 60 to 90 minutes. The dough can be refrigerated until ready to use, with a damp cloth over it.\nFor the sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chile flakes and garlic and cook until the garlic softens, about 1 minute. Add the tomato puree and basil sprigs. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool completely in the fridge. Remove the basil from the sauce before using.\nFor the crust: Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Prepare a 12-inch cast-iron pan by greasing the interior with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.\nDivide the dough into 2 portions and roll out 1 portion on a floured surface, making a round sheet roughly 14 inches wide. (Wrap the other dough portion in plastic wrap and freeze for another use.) Place the dough sheet over the greased pan, lightly pressing the interior corners into the pan to prevent pockets. Place the strips of smoked mozzarella around the interior of the pan, making a circle with the strips along the entire edge. Cut the dough approximately 1 inch above the level of the cheese. Roll the dough over the cheese, lightly tucking the edges underneath to form a stuffed crust. Brush the stuffed crust with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.\nFor the toppings: Ladle the sauce into the center of the pizza, creating a thin layer that barely covers the pizza. Finish by topping with the torn mozzarella, olives, and onions.\nPlace the pizza pan over medium heat and cook until the bottom of the crust begins to brown lightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the oven and bake until the crust is golden brown and the center is bubbly, about 20 minutes.\nUse a large metal spatula to remove the pizza, then top with the torn basil and a drizzle of olive oil.

  "Open Faced Sausage, 3 Pepper and Onion Sandwiches with Provolone": {
    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nIf you are cooking a make-ahead meal with bread that will not be used for a couple of days, place it in the freezer in an airtight bag or wrap well. Unwrap to defrost at room temperature and then crust in a warm oven.\nMeanwhile, heat a couple of tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, cubanelle peppers, chile pepper, and garlic to tender-crisp, 5 minutes more.\nCool and store the mushroom mixture. To reheat the mushroom mixture: Add a splash of stock or water over medium heat and season with salt and pepper.\nTo reheat the sausages: Add a splash of stock or water to the sausages to loosen the sauce. Add a ladle of sauce to the mushroom pan.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Split the bread horizontally then halve into 4 large pieces. Arrange the bread pieces on cooling racks set over baking sheets to allow the heat to circulate all around the bread. Halve the sausages lengthwise. Dot the bread with sauce, top with the sausages cut-side-down, dot with more sauce and top with peppers and cheese. Bake the bread 12 to 15 minutes, or until melted and brown at the edges. Garnish with parsley and serve.\nFor the braciole: Defrost, drain, and wring the frozen organic spinach dry in a clean kitchen towel and separate with your fingertips while adding to a mixing bowl. Season the spinach with salt, black pepper, and a little nutmeg. Add the chopped hard-boiled eggs, currants, pine nuts, finely chopped garlic, and cheese to the bowl and gently combine. Season the meat with salt and pepper and arrange each steak with one of the narrow ends near you. Divide the filling evenly among the meat slices. Scatter the filling over the meat leaving a 1/2-inch edge or border on the sides. Fold the edge over the filling and tuck in the edges as you roll each bundle to secure the filling. Wrap and roll the remaining bundles and secure with kitchen twine to cover the ends and middle, like wrapping a package.\nHeat a large Dutch oven with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil a couple of turns of the pan over medium-high heat. Brown the meat bundles 6 to 8 minutes to evenly caramelize the meat all over.\nFor the sauce: Remove the bundles from the pan and add 1 tablespoon more olive oil, give a turn of the pan to coat. Add the chopped carrots, onions, sliced garlic, bay leaf and season with salt and pepper. Let the vegetables cook 5 minutes to soften, then stir in the chopped rosemary and sage for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and stir to develop the fragrance, then add the white wine and scrape up the pan drippings. Stir in the chicken stock and tomatoes. Break up the tomatoes with a spoon or potato masher. Bring the sauce to a bubble, add the meat back to the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook 2 hours more, stirring occasionally.\nAfter 2 hours, brown the sausages in a frying pan with a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil, a turn of the pan. Add the browned links to the sauce and gently submerge them, nestling them in with the meat bundles. Simmer the mixture 30 minutes more to cook the sausages through and combine their flavor into the sauce.\nBring a pot of water to a boil for pasta. Salt the water and cook the pasta to al dente. Reserve a cup of starchy cooking liquid just before draining.\nRemove the meat bundles to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Remove the sausages to a separate plate to cool.\nDrain the pasta and return to a hot pot. Add 1 tablespoon butter, cut into pieces, and half of the sauce, toss to combine, adding a little starchy cooking water to make it all come together for you.\nCut the string from the meat and serve the meat dotted with more sauce and sprinkled with fresh parsley on large dinner plates with hot pappardelle pasta topped with fresh basil and some shaved Parm alongside.",

Holding the cone in your hand fill with 2 tablespoons of filling. Seal the top by bringing the edges together and crimping with your fingers or a fork. Do this with the rest to make 8 samosas.

  "Sunny's BK Jagerschnitzel with Sunny's Lemon-Thyme Spaetzle": {
    "instructions": "For the chops: Use a rolling pin to flatten the chops to a little less than 1/2-inch thin. Sprinkle the chops with salt and pepper.\nSet up the dredging station: Get 3 large bowls or plates in a row, with the last one closest to your stove. Place a plate next to the last bowl. In the first bowl, add the flour. In the middle bowl, add the eggs with a splash of water. In the last bowl, add the breadcrumbs, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, dried sage, cardamom, Hungarian paprika, salt, black pepper, chili powder and lemon zest. Stir with a fork.\nDredge the chops: First, take each seasoned chop and dredge in the flour, shaking off any excess flour. Dip each in the egg, and then press each into the breading mixture, making sure to completely cover both sides. Remove each to the resting plate.\nFry the chops: In a large pan over medium-high heat, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Cook the chops until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and set aside. To keep warm, cover gently with aluminum foil and do not seal (or place in a warm oven anywhere from 100 to 150 degrees F, uncovered).\nFor the gravy base: In the same pan on medium heat, add more oil if needed. Add the carrots, celery, half the onions, thyme, bay leaf, a pinch of salt and a grind or two of black pepper. Cook while stirring until everything is tender and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Raise the heat and add the wine, using a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits that cling to the bottom of the pan. When the wine has reduced by about half, add the beef broth. Bring to a simmer and reduce the sauce by half, about 10 minutes. Pour the sauce through a sieve into a bowl, pressing down to get the most liquid out of the solids. Set aside.\nFinish the mushroom gravy: Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel. Over medium heat, add the butter and melt, but don't brown it. If the heat is too high, lower it. Then add the remaining chopped onions, the mushrooms, a pinch of salt and a grind or two of pepper. Cook while stirring until tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle over the flour and stir while cooking a few more minutes until the veggies soak up the flour. Add the reserved sauce base back to the pan and bring to a simmer. Cook while stirring until thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve poured over the cooked chops. Serve with Sunny's Lemon-Thyme Spaetzle.\nFor the batter: In a bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, thyme, salt, black pepper, ground mustard, cayenne pepper, nutmeg and lemon zest. Gradually whisk in the flour to make a thick, tight batter. Add more flour by the spoonful until the proper texture is met (this should feel like it won't drip through a colander whole, but can be pressed through and remain stringy, not doughy).\nBoil the spaetzle: Fill a double boiler halfway with water and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and place a colander over the pot. Add a heaping cup of spaetzle batter at a time to the colander and, with a rubber spatula, press the batter through the holes into the boiling water. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the colander between pressings and stir the spaetzle into the water so the next group of batter doesn't stick to the one before it. The spaetzle is cooked when it floats to the top. Remove with a fine mesh sieve and strain to remove as much water as possible (shake it!).\nPan fry the spaetzle: In a large pan on medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook until crisp.

Combine the rosemary, sage, and butter for the herb crust in a small bowl. Season, to taste, with kosher salt. Work the butter under the skin of the turkey and massage it into the breasts and the legs. Massage the butter on the outside of the skin as well. Tie the legs together over the breast so they will protect it during cooking and help keep it moist and juicy.\nGravy preparation: Put the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, apples, bay leaves, cinnamon stick and thyme in a roasting pan and season with salt. Arrange the turkey on top of the veggies and refrigerate overnight UNCOVERED! Yes, that's right, uncovered. This will help the skin dry out and become really brown and crispy. Make sure that there is no raw food near the turkey in the refrigerator. After refrigerating overnight, the turkey is ready to go in the oven.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F.\nPut 2 cups chicken stock and 1 cup apple cider in the bottom of the roasting pan. Roast the turkey in the preheated oven until the skin gets really nice and brown, about 40 minutes. Lower the oven heat to 350 degrees F for the remainder of the cooking time. Baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so and add more stock to the roasting pan, if needed. Cook about 17 minutes per pound. Once it gets to the proper color, tent the turkey with aluminum foil to prevent it from getting too dark.\nRemove the turkey from the oven when an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the turkey registers 160 degrees F. Make sure that the thermometer is not touching a bone when doing the reading. When the turkey has reached the proper temperature, remove it from the roasting pan to a cutting board and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.\nStrain all the veggies over a bowl to separate them from the stock/mixture. Discard the veggies. Skim off the fat and add it to the roasting pan.

  "Caribbean Pineapple Upside-Down Cake": {
    "instructions": "For the caramel topping: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter just the sides of a 9-inch round cake pan.\nStir the sugar and 1/3 cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Cook, no longer stirring, but gently swirling the saucepan occasionally until the mixture is the color of light amber, 4 to 5 minutes. (If needed, brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a pastry brush dampened with water.) Remove the saucepan from the heat, and carefully whisk in the butter (use caution; the mixture can bubble up considerably). Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan, tilting the pan to cover most of the bottom (be careful; the pan will be very hot from the caramel). Lay the pineapple rings in the pan and fill each hole evenly with the chiles. Set aside.\nFor the cake: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and crushed red pepper flakes in a medium bowl; set aside. Combine the coconut milk, buttermilk and vanilla in a small bowl; set aside.\nBeat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition and scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk mixture and mixing until just incorporated.\nPour the batter over the pineapple in the cake pan and spread evenly. Bake until the cake is golden brown and bounces back when pressed and a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the center, 50 to 60 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to separate it from the pan. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until just cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes. Invert a serving platter over the cake pan and, while holding them together, quickly flip them over so the cake unmolds, pineapple-side up. Let cool completely. Cut into wedges, and serve.",

Start to melt suet in the pan over medium heat, using long chopsticks (or a fondue fork) to move it around so the entire pan bottom is well greased. The fat should smoke slightly. Quickly sprinkle about 3 tablespoons of sugar over the bottom and continue moving the fat in the pan (it should not be entirely melted yet.) The sugar will caramelize, turning brown and sticky. At this point, add about 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sake. There will be some sputtering (but this helps entertain guests). Add sake, stir; add dark soy sauce, stir. Begin the cooking by laying a few slices of beef into the pan. The beef should take about 1 minute to cook. Add more beef, switch to vegetables-including shirataki, tofu and fu-then alternate back to beef. Each diner should put into the pan whatever he or she likes. Add water (or half water/half sake) to the pan occasionally, as the sauce is reduced. The ingredients should not swim in the sauce; the liquid should just keep the pan bottom covered.\nSet each place with an individual dipping bowl into which an egg has been broken. This alone is the dipping sauce. (If you serve a whole egg at each place, which is attractive, provide a saucer or some vessel for the empty shells.) Each diner mixes the egg with chopsticks or fork. As with the other nabemono, long-handled fondue forks are best for anyone who is a little shy about using chopsticks, but dinner forks will do in a pinch.\nBefore eating, dip cooked meat and vegetables into the egg; the thin coating of egg \"cooks\" on as soon as it is in contact with the hot food. There is no other garnish or relish. To end the meal, serve hot cooked rice, mild pickles, and Japanese tea as a final course. Serve hot sake or cold beer up to rice course.\nSuggested Sake: Rich Sake\n*Have your butcher cut well-marbled sirloin beef into very thin slices. .\n**Buy grilled bean curd (yakidofu) or use any type of bean surd (tofu) available. .",

    "instructions": "For the pickled carrots: In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, vinegar, and salt until dissolved. Add the carrots, toss to coat and allow to pickle for about 2 hours. For the pork: Combine the soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, five-spice powder, garam masala, black pepper, garlic and shallots in a re-sealable plastic bag. Seal and shake until well dissolved. Add the pork to the bag, massage the marinade into the pork and marinate for 1 hour. When you're ready to cook the pork, grab a large cast-iron skillet. Place the pan over high heat until it is smoking. Using a pair of tongs, pull each pork chop out of the marinade, shake off the excess and place it in the pan. Don't crowd the pan - no meat should be touching! You want the meat to sear, not steam. After about 2 minutes, flip each chop; it should be a caramel brown color. Cook another minute on the other side and remove from the pan. If you're cooking in batches, cook the remaining chops. Slice the chops into thin strips. For the sandwiches: Warm the tortillas up over an open flame so they become soft and pliable. I also like to char them a little! If you don't have a gas stove, warm them in a pan over medium heat, or pop them in a microwave for 10 to 15 seconds. Smear a little mayo down the middle of the tortilla. Then, pile a little layer of pickled carrots, some cucumber slices, a few sprigs of cilantro, some mint leaves, pork chop strips, a few slices of chiles a and squeeze of fresh lime juice over the top. Wrap, and secure with toothpick. Wrap in parchment paper if you're taking them to the beach, or just eat right away if you're not!;\nAdd the green cardamom seeds, cloves, black cardamom seeds and cinnamon sticks to a spice/coffee grinder and grind until fine.

Rinse the chickpeas and return them to the pot. Add the remaining teaspoon baking soda and water to cover by about 3 inches over the chickpeas. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, skimming off and discarding any foam that rises to the surface. Cook the chickpeas until tender but still hold their shape, about 30 minutes. Remove 1 cup of chickpeas from the pot with a slotted spoon. Drain well and reserve on a paper towel-lined plate to dry. Continue cooking the remaining chickpeas until they are mostly intact and soft and creamy (not crumbly) when pressed between a thumb and forefinger, about 10 minutes more. If the liquid boils off too much while cooking, add more water to cover and continue to cook.\nMeanwhile, make the parsley oil. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the parsley leaves and cook 10 seconds, then drain. Immediately run the parsley under very cold water to cool it completely, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Squeeze out the excess liquid and then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to dry.\nWhen the chickpeas are done cooking, strain them and discard the liquid.

Add one-quarter of the butter; process until it disappears into the flour, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining butter and pulse until the mixture looks like cornmeal with bean-size bits of butter. Combine the water and vodka and drizzle over the flour mixture. Pulse until the dough just starts coming together but stop before it gathers into a ball. Divide evenly between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and gently pat each into a disk, using the plastic wrap to help you. (If the dough seems dry with large bits of butter, turn it out onto a work surface and use the heel of your hand to press the dough together.)

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add the apples and cook, tossing occasionally, until juicy, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; fold in the cherries, flour, extract and allspice. Transfer to a bowl and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.\nRoll out 1 disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate; refrigerate until ready to fill. Place a piece of parchment paper on an inverted baking sheet. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round, transfer to the parchment and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.\nTransfer the dough (on the parchment) to a work surface.

Using a pastry cutter or your hands, cut in the chilled butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.\nStir together the sweet potato and buttermilk in a separate bowl until smooth. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the sweet potato mixture. Add the raisins and combine until it just comes together. Be very careful to not over mix.\nTurn the dough onto a floured surface and knead until it comes together. If the dough is too sticky, work in up to 1/4 cup additional flour. Shape into a disk and pat to an even 1- to 1 1/2-inch thickness. With a floured 3-inch round biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits. Gather together scraps, and repeat to cut out more biscuits.\nButter a baking sheet and place each biscuit 1/2 inch apart. Brush with melted butter and bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.\nReduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.\nFor the peppered pork loin: In a small bowl, stir together the sorghum, salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper and oil. Trim the pork loin of any excess fat, and transfer to a shallow roasting pan (or my favorite, a cast-iron skillet). Rub the pork loin with sorghum and spice mixture, coating evenly. Roast until the internal temperature is 140 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes.\nFor the apple mustard butter: Place the apple chunks in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over low heat. Cook, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon and allspice. Continue cooking over low heat, stirring occasionally, until very thick, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the mustard. (Or if using applesauce, place in a heavy bottomed pot with the sugar and spices and cook until it is thick, 30 minutes or so.)\nFor the salad: Toss the arugula, tomatoes and sunflowers seeds in a large bowl. Drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Top with the shaved cheese.\nTo serve: Split the sweet potato biscuits and spread the apple mustard butter on both sides. Thinly slice the pork loin and place on each of the bottom biscuits. Top with the other biscuit halves and serve with salad on the side.\nRecipe courtesy of Damaris Phillips",

  "Breakfast Pizza: Pizza A Colazione": {
    "instructions": "For the pizza dough: In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the yeast, lukewarm water, and 1/2 cup of the bread flour. Mix well and let it sit for 30 minutes, or until bubbly, like foamy beer. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 3 1/2 cups bread flour and the salt until evenly combined.\nAdd 3/4 cup cold water and the olive oil to the yeast mixture. Turn on the mixer and begin adding the flour mixture in increments, then mix for 5 minutes, until the dough starts creeping up the dough hook and detaching from the sides of the bowl.\nGrease a large bowl with oil and transfer the dough to the bowl. Turn the dough to coat its surface with oil. Cover the bowl loosely with a tea towel. Let the dough rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Punch the dough down, then let rise another 1 hour.\nDivide the dough into 4 equal pieces and form into discs. On a work surface lightly dusted with flour, use your fingers or the heel of your hand (and a rolling pin, if you prefer) to stretch the discs until they're 13 inches in diameter. The disc should be very thin, less than 1/8 inch.\nFor the pizza: Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F for 1 hour before baking. (Or preheat a wood-fired pizza oven to very hot, 4 hours before baking.)\nIn a food processor, puree the tomatoes until smooth. Season with salt to taste.\nIn a skillet, heat the olive oil and pancetta over medium heat and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until crisp.\nUsing a spoon, spread one-fourth of the pureed tomatoes on 1 disc of dough, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Sprinkle one-fourth of the mozzarella on top. Gently place the pizza on the pizza stone and bake for about 5 minutes, until golden with slight signs of charring. (If using a wood-fired oven, gently place the pizza on the oven floor, and bake for 3 minutes, or until golden and crisp.)\nRemove the pizza from the oven and break an egg over the center of the pizza. Top with one-fourth of the cooked pancetta, return the pizza to the oven, and bake another 3 to 4 minutes (1 to 2 minutes if using a wood-fired oven), until the egg is cooked.\nRemove the pizza from the oven, transfer to a cutting board, and top with one-fourth of the basil. Serve immediately. Repeat with the remaining 3 pizza discs. IMPORTANTE! If you're making pizza within the hour after forming the pizza dough discs, they can be kept at room temperature. Otherwise, place them on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 12 hours before baking, as long as the dough doesn't rise too much, because acidity will creep in and the flavor will sour. Ideally, though, you should make the pizzas the same day you make the dough.",

Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover. Cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes.\nTransfer the chicken to a plate. Cool until easy to handle. Discard the skin and bones and coarsely chop the meat. Transfer to a medium bowl.\nMeanwhile, let the cooking liquid stand off the heat for 5 minutes. Skim off and discard the fat on the surface. Return the skillet to the stove and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the liquid is reduced to a thick glaze, about 20 minutes. Scrape the glaze onto the chicken, then add the cheese.\nTo make the tamales, place a corn husk on the work surface. Spread about 3 tablespoons of the Classic Cornbread batter in a 2 to 3-inch square area in the center of the husk. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the chicken in the center of the batter and top with about 1 tablespoon of the batter. Fold the sides of the husk to enclose the batter (the tamale is now about 2 1/2 inches wide). Fold over the ends of the husk so the tamale is about 3 inches long. Place the tamale, smooth side up, on the work surface. Using kitchen twine, tie up the tamale with kitchen string, gift-box fashion. Repeat with the remaining husks, batter and chicken. (You may have some husks left over since you soaked more than you needed, in case some got torn.) Stand the tamales up, side by side, in a steamer inserted in a large pot. Add enough water to the pot to barely reach the bottom of the steamer. Cover tightly and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low. Steam the tamales until the batter is firm (open a tamale to check), about 1 hour. (The tamales can be made up to 8 hours ahead, cooled, and refrigerated.

Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each until thoroughly incorporated. Add the vanilla. Scrape the bowl again and mix for a few more seconds. On low speed, add 1/2 the dry ingredients. Beat until combined. Add the remaining dry ingredients and beat just until the flour is completely absorbed into the dough.\nTurn the dough onto the table, gather it together, and knead gently into a smooth mass. Form it into a log and divide into 3 even parts. Flatten each section into a patty about 1/2-inch thick and cover each with plastic wrap. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days. The dough may also be frozen for up to 1 month.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Let the dough sit at room temperature, still covered, for about 20 minutes to soften slightly. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough to slightly more than 1/8-inch thick.\nCut out shapes with cookie cutters, as close together as possible, and use a palate knife or metal spatula to transfer to ungreased baking sheets, placing them about 1-inch apart. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Press the scraps together, roll them out, and cut, always brushing off any excess flour, until all used up.\nBake cookies for about 17 minutes, or until the edges begin to turn golden. Let sit for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a bowl using a handheld mixer, begin to beat the egg whites and sugar on low speed. Be sure the bowl and beaters are free of any fat and that there is no egg yolk in the whites. After 30 seconds or so, scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula and gradually increase the speed of the mixer to medium. Beat until the mixer thickens and stiffens, about 3 minutes.\nSTORING ICING: Keep Royal Icing in an airtight container. To prevent a crust from forming while using the icing, keep the container covered with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Royal Icing will keep refrigerated for up to 2 days. Before reusing, lightly beat with a whisk or fork.\nYield: 2 1/2 cups icing to cover about 4 to 6 dozen 3-inch cookies\n*RAW EGG WARNING\nFood Network Kitchens suggest caution in consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs due to the slight risk of Salmonella or other food-borne illness.

Cover the bowl with plastic and let sit for an hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.\nPunch down the dough.\nFor the bombolino: With slightly floured fingers, using about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the dough, flatten the dough into a small disk about 1/4-inch thick.\nPlace about 1 teaspoon of the cheese in the center and wrap the dough around the cheese. Pinch the dough together so that it sticks together and then roll the dough into a small ball. It is very important to make sure the dough is seamless, so that when it cooks no melted cheese escapes. Repeat until you have as many bombolino as you have salads. You will have excess dough.\nHeat a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F, or heat up 2 inches of oil in a high-sided heavy-bottomed pan.

Add 1 teaspoon of the oil as needed. Be very careful about how much oil to add as the almonds will get smoother the more they are processed. Use only as much as needed to achieve a smooth but thick almond paste.\nSeason with cayenne pepper and salt, to taste.\nPlace in a container. Will last refrigerated for up to 3 days. Reseason as needed.\nFor the beet salad: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nTrim tops and tails of beets and wash.\nPlace in roasting pan and add enough water to pan so that it reaches half up the side of the beets. Cover with aluminum foil and place in preheated oven. Check doneness after about 45 minutes. If a pairing knife is able to penetrate the beet very easily, the beets are cooked.

Let them sit until they reach room temperature. Do not discard the water.\nUsing a kitchen towel (that you are not afraid to get really messy), peel the skin off the beets. The skin should wipe off very easily. To get off any little pieces of skin you might have missed, rinse in the water they were cooked in. Once all the beets are peeled, discard skins and the water they were cooked in.\nCut beets in quarters or thirds, depending on their size and your preference.\nMix gingerly with shallots, chives, oil and vinegar.\nTo plate: Smooth about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the almond butter on the plate.

With the motor running, add the egg and the oil, and then pour the water in a slow, steady stream until the dough forms a ball around the blade. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 2 minutes, until smooth. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 2 balls. On a floured surface, with a floured rolling pin, roll out one of the balls very thinly, to about 1/16th of an inch, making sure that it doesn't tear. With a cookie cutter, or a cup, cut out circles about 3 inches in diameter. Place a heaping teaspoon of the desired filling in the middle of a circle. Fold the dough over to form a semi-circle. Brush the edges with the egg and press firmly with the tines of the fork to seal. Place the vareniki as they are made on a large, lightly floured, platter, and cover with a damp cloth, while making the next batch. Repeat with the second ball of dough. Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderate and carefully lower half of the vareniki into the water. Boil, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until they rise to the surface, about 6 to 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon, carefully remove the vareniki into a colander and drain thoroughly. Transfer into a deep serving bowl and toss with half of the butter.;\nIn a small skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and saute the onion until deeply colored, about 10 minutes.

  "Marzipan": {
    "instructions": "In an electric coffee grinder, grind the blanched almonds in small batches into a fine powder. Sift the powder through a fine sieve into a large bowl. Regrind any almond particles remaining in the sifter. In a bowl whisk the egg whites with the salt until they are frothy, whisk the vanilla, and stir the mixture into the almond powder. Sift in 3 cups of confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, kneading the mixture together in the bowl, and sift enough of the remaining 1 cup sugar to form a smooth, pliable dough (add more sugar if the dough is too sticky). Quarter the dough and wrap each piece tightly in foil. The marzipan paste keeps, chilled, in an airtight container for up to 8 weeks.;\nWork with 1 piece of marzipan at a time, keeping the remaining marzipan covered tightly. Pull off a piece of marzipan paste, form it into a smooth ball by rolling it between the palms, and shape it gently into the desired shape. (Wipe hands occasionally with a damp cloth.)\nTo achieve the texture of citrus fruit roll the marzipan shape over a fine grater or sieve. A small wire loop may be pressed into the back of the thickest part of the marzipan if the marzipan is for hanging.\nLet the marzipan dry on sheets of foil overnight and with a large soft watercolor brush dipped in the food coloring, tint it as desired. If a shading effect is desired add the second coat of coloring before the first coat dries.\nLet the marzipan dry on foil for 2 days and with a fine soft water color brush dipped in the food coloring add any fine details desired. Wooden picks, broken into small pieces and colored with food coloring, may be used to form the stems of fruits. Cloves may be used to form the blossom end of fruits such as apples and pears. White paper may be cut and colored with food coloring to form the leaves for fruits, or any small leaves may be used.\nAfter the marzipan has had its final coat of food coloring let it dry on sheets of foil for1 day. The marzipan keeps, chilled, in an airtight container for up to 8 weeks.\nYield: 25 small marzipan shapes",

Pierce some small holes in the foil so steam can escape and place the jars into a roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with water halfway up the sides of the jars so that they bake evenly.

  "Roasted Leg of Lamb with Serrano Chile-Mint Jelly and Roasted New Potato Medley": {

(This should be done at least 4 hours in advance, preferably overnight). In a large bowl, mix together potatoes, onions, carrots, garlic and thyme. Add oil, season and mix well. When pan is hot, pull out and dump veggies into the pan. There should be a good sizzle. Mix the veggies around and roast for 10 minutes. Mix again and place lamb on top.

  "Risotto": {
    "instructions": "Preparing the Rice\nPeel and finely chop the onion.\nMelt the butter in a 4-to-5-quart saucepan over medium heat, stirring regularly.\nAdd the onion and cook, continuing to stir, until it turns soft and translucent. Turn the heat down if the onion starts to brown.\nMeanwhile, pour the chicken broth into a separate saucepan, set over medium heat, and bring to a gentle simmer. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain this simmer the whole time you are preparing the risotto.\nOnce the onion is soft, add the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary -- if the rice is cooked at too high a heat, it will turn brown and take on an undesirable flavor.\nAdding the Liquid to the Rice\nUsing a ladle, scoop up about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of broth. Pour it in the pan with the rice, stirring constantly with a spoon. After the first addition of broth, the rice mixture will look a bit soupy.\nAs the rice begins to cook, stir it constantly, making sure that you scrape along the bottom of the pan so that it does not stick. You should see little bubbles popping up on the liquid from time to time. If it bubbles more vigorously than this, turn the heat down to medium-low.\nWhen most of the liquid is absorbed into the rice and the rice begins to look a bit dry, add another ladle of broth to the pan and stir constantly, as before.\nDetermining When the Risotto Is Cooked\nContinue to add the broth in 1/2-to-3/4-cup batches and stir the rice until you have used most of the broth (this will probably take about 20 minutes). It is now time to test whether the risotto is cooked. Spoon up a grain of rice and bite into it -- it should be tender without being too mushy. If it is still crunchy and tastes a bit starchy, you will need to continue adding liquid and cooking further.\nIf it looks as if you will run out of chicken broth and your rice is still not cooked, don't be alarmed. Because of variations in individual stoves and cooking temperatures, you may need more liquid than called for in the recipe. Simply heat up another cup or 2 of chicken broth. If you run out of broth, use hot water.\nWhen the rice is tender and the risotto has a creamy consistency, almost like thick oatmeal, it is done.\nServing the Risotto\nAdd salt and pepper to the risotto, about 1/4 teaspoon at a time, until it seems well seasoned to you. Stir.\nAdd the grated Parmesan cheese and stir well.\nServe the risotto immediately in warm bowls and have extra grated Parmesan on hand.\nRisotto with Tomatoes and Basil:\nTake 4 Roma tomatoes, cut off and discard the stem tops, and cut the tomatoes into small pieces. Chop enough fresh basil leaves into small pieces to make about 1 cup. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet, and turn the heat to medium-high. When the bottom of the skillet feels hot when you put your open hand 1 inch from the bottom, add the tomatoes and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Stir for 3 or 4 minutes, until they seem soft. Put the cooked tomatoes aside, and when the risotto is done, stir the tomatoes and basil into the hot risotto. Stir to mix well; taste for salt and add some if needed. Serve immediately and pass some grated Parmesan cheese.\nRisotto with Spinach and Garlic:\nPeel and chop 3 large cloves of garlic into small pieces, and put them on a piece of waxed paper. Rinse 1/2 bunch of spinach leaves, and shake off the excess water. Cut off the stems, bunch the leaves up, and cut them into thin strips, then cut crosswise into small pieces. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. When the bottom of the skillet feels hot when you put your open hand, palm side down, 1 inch from the bottom of the skillet, it is ready. Add the garlic to the oil and stir for a minute. Turn the heat to low, and add the spinach. Press the spinach down with a spatula, lightly salt and pepper it, and turn it over with a spatula. The spinach will wilt down almost immediately. Take the skillet off the stove, put a lid on the skillet, and when the risotto is done, stir the garlic and spinach into the risotto. Serve immediately, and pass some grated Parmesan cheese.",

  "Alaskan Halibut, Salmon and Crab Roulade": {
    "instructions": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.\nCut halibut and salmon into appropriate weights, cover each piece with plastic wrap and pound out with flat side of a meat tenderizer, or meat mallet, to 1/4-inch thickness. In a small bowl combine crabmeat, Brie cheese, 1 tablespoon fresh chopped herbs, 1 tablespoon shallot, 1 teaspoon minced garlic and salt and pepper, to taste. Season both sides of halibut with salt, pepper and some of the fresh herbs. Lay on an individual piece of plastic wrap, twice as big as the fish piece, flesh side down. Lay salmon piece on top of halibut, directly in the middle. Season with salt and pepper. Spread 1/4th of the crab and Brie mixture in the middle of the salmon. Do this with all 4 pieces of fish. Take plastic wrap that the fish is laying on and wrap fish into a tight roll, twisting the ends to make a \"tube\". Refrigerate.\nToss yams, roughly chopped garlic, thyme sprigs and olive oil in a bowl until completely coated. Season with salt and pepper. Spread evenly on a sheet pan and roast in a 350 degree F oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until tender. While yams are roasting combine Riesling and 2 tablespoons shallots in a small saucepan. Reduce by 3/4 over medium-low heat. Whisk in butter a little at a time until completely combined. Once all the butter is beaten in, remove from heat and season with salt. When yams have about 10 minutes left to finish, take fish rolls from the refrigerator and slice each roll into 3 or 5 equal sections. Remove plastic wrap after cutting and lay shingled out on well greased sheet pan and put into oven with yams. When yams are done, fish should be done as well. While fish and yams are cooking, heat saute pan with 1 tablespoon whole butter. Once hot, drop mushrooms into pan and saute over medium-high heat until crispy and tender. Season with 1 tablespoon shallot, 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic, salt and pepper, to taste. Remove yams and fish from oven.

  "Orange-Cardamom Roast Chicken": {
    "instructions": "In a small bowl, combine the butter, cardamom, orange zest, ginger, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; set aside.\nButterfly the chicken: Place on a cutting board, breast-side down with the neck toward you. Using a pair of sharp kitchen shears (and your biceps), cut through the bones on either side of the backbone; the spine should come away in a narrow strip, which you can discard or save for stock. Flip the bird over, breasts facing up and closest to you. Using the heel of your palm and your body weight, push down on the breastbone; you should hear it crack. The chicken should lie flat now. Rotate the drumsticks toward the center line of the body so she looks a little knock-kneed. There you go. You just butterflied a chicken!\nSlide your fingers between the flesh and the skin over the breasts, thighs and drumsticks. Use a teaspoon to deposit a little of the flavored butter into each pocket and smooth it out over each part of the chicken, making sure the butter is evenly spread, then pat the skin dry.\nToss the potato slices with the sunflower oil, season with salt and pepper and let them sit in a bowl at room temperature alongside the chicken for 30 minutes. Give your oven a quick wipe down before preheating it to 500 degrees F. (The high temps will cause any leftover drips to smoke you out of your kitchen! If your oven still smokes, then turn it down to 450 degrees F after the first 10 minutes.)\nDrain off the water that's been drawn from the potatoes and pour the potatoes into an even layer in a large cast-iron skillet. Place the chicken on top of the potatoes and tuck the wings under her shoulders. Pop the whole kit 'n' kaboodle into the oven. Cook for 20 minutes. Rotate the skillet and cook for 20 more minutes, until the skin is crispy, the juices run clear and the thickest part of the breast registers 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer.\nRemove the chicken from the oven and set aside to rest for 10 minutes on a cutting board, loosely tented with foil. Using a fish spatula or slotted spoon, gently turn the potatoes. If you'd like them crispier, pop them under your broiler for 3 to 5 minutes. Scoop out the potatoes onto a platter, leaving behind the pan grease. Cut the chicken into pieces, place them on top of the potatoes and serve with boldness and courage!\nFind more recipes from Aarti in her cookbook, Aarti Paarti ($28, Grand Central Publishing).\nPhotograph by Ryan Liebe",

  "Pate a Choux Centerpiece": {
    "instructions": "How to Make a Cornet, method follows\nMake the centerpiece: Use a marker to trace the shapes of the centerpiece on a sheet of parchment paper in a sheet pan. Depending on how well you space your drawing for the entire centerpiece, you will need 4 to 5 set ups of parchment paper lined sheet pans. Starting with the centerpiece layers, draw 3 round bases of gradual size: draw the first circle 8 inches in diameter, the second circle about 5 inches in diameter and the third circle about 3 inches in diameter. Fill each circle by drawing a crosshatch pattern spacing your lines 1/2 to 3/4-inch apart. Turn the traced paper over so the ink does not transfer to the pate a choux. Place the pate a choux in a piping bag with a 1/4-inch straight tip and trace the base shapes you drew.\nTo make the supports for the base: Using the same technique used to trace the 3 round bases, draw 5 curled lines that resemble a decorative letter S about 6 inches tall. These will sit between the largest and middle-sized base. Then make the same shape in a smaller size, about 3 inches tall, you will need 3 of the smaller S shapes. Turn the traced paper over so the ink does not transfer to the pate a choux. Trace the S shapes with the piping bag filled with the pate a choux.\nTo make the butterflies: begin by making the butterfly wings, draw the shape of a teardrop about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long. Draw a second tear drop, the same size as the first, they should be connected, round end to round end in order to create a wing shape. Draw 10 sets of wings, this will give you 5 butterflies. Place more pate a choux in a paper cornet (see How to Make a Cornet). Trim the tip so you can draw a very fine line. Trace the outline of the butterfly wings with the pate a choux. Then, in a freeform style, draw a narrower teardrop shape within the boundaries of each of the larger teardrops. Make sure the smaller teardrops connect with the larger teardrops at both ends. To make the body of the butterfly, using the same cornet, pipe 2-inch strips making a thick end (the head) and gradually tapering off. To make the antennae simply pipe a 1 1/2-inch V shape. You will need 5 sets of bodies and 5 sets of antennae.\nBake the pate a choux in the oven at 320 degrees F for about 20 minutes.\nHow to Make a Cornet:\nThe Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations.\nCut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper.\nHold the middle of the long side of the triangle between 2 fingers of 1 hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side.\nRelease your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone.\nRoll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet.\nTo close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size.\nPrepare the pate a choux: Place the water, salt, granulated sugar, and butter in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, set it over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the bread flour all at once and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spoon.\nReturn the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, push the paste from side to side with the wooden spoon. Turn it onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, which helps it dry. Keep the paste moving, or it will burn. The paste will dry out and leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer set on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. Continue to mix and slowly add the eggs 1 at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth again. The number of eggs used will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 2 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about 1foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in 1 big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated.\nTo make the caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup and water in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until light golden brown. Pour the caramel into a heatproof bowl to hold the temperature of the sugar. Put a towel under the bowl to keep it from tipping and to protect your hands from the heat of the glass.\nAssemble the centerpiece: The caramel acts as glue. Dip the bottom of the first large S into the caramel and stick it to the largest base going from the out side rim of the circle, towards the center of the circle. In other words, the base supports should almost meet each other in the center of the circle. This creates a structure for the next layer to rest on. You will have to hold each S support in place in order for the caramel to harden and actually stick, keeping the S shape in the right position. Repeat using the other 4 pieces, spacing them evenly. Dip the bottom of the first small S into the caramel and stick it to the medium-sized base. Repeat using the other pieces, again spacing them evenly. Place the medium size base on the large S supports. Top the small S supports with the smallest base. You will have a 3 tiered structure.\nTo assemble the butterflies: using the caramel as glue, connect 2 sets of the wings together. Do this along length of the wings. Adjust the wings to sit at a slight angle, as though the wings are in mid-flight. Do this with all 10 wing sets, creating 5 total butterflies. Using a paring knife dipped in the caramel to spread it might be easier than dipping the wings or bodies in the bowl of caramel. You may need to prop the wings up while they harden. You can do so using 2 rolling pins or 2 thick books lying with about 2 inches between them. The space between them is where the glued center juncture will rest on the work surface and you will be able let the wings harden on a slight angle; this way you will not have to hold them in place until they harden. Using more caramel, glue the bodies to the area where you glued the wings together. Place the fatter end of the body at the top section where the wings are joined. Glue the antenna to the fatter part of the bodies. If at some point during the gluing process the caramel has become to stiff to use; place the caramel in the microwave oven at 30-second intervals, until it loosens up for you to use it again. Once the butterflies have been assembled and the caramel has hardened, you can then glue them wherever you like on the 3-tiered centerpiece.\nPlace the centerpiece on a large tray. Display the Bomboloni and the Cloud Puffs around the centerpiece. Voila!",

Set aside on the counter up to 2 hours to marinate. You could also marinate the meat overnight in the fridge.\nFor the compote: Heat the olive oil in a very large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering (not smoking), add the onions, a pinch of salt, and stir to coat with oil. Cover and reduce the heat to low.

It should be smooth and elastic. Form it into a ball and place it in a clean, oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 4 to 8 hours.\nAfternoon or Evening:\nAbout 45 minutes before you want to bake, spread out the dough on a lightly floured counter, cut the dough in half with a dough scraper, and roll it into 2 logs.

  "Beef Filet in Salt Crust": {
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Pour the boxes of salt into a large braising pot and heat in the oven until unbearably hot to the top of the hand. Meanwhile, place the veal stock in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat and reduce to 1 cup. Add the lemon rind, capers, garlic, parsley and pepper, to taste. Keep warm in a hot water bath to prevent further reduction.\nTrim the fillet, removing all traces of fat and silver skin between the muscles. Tie the roast with fine string at 1-inch intervals. Blanch the fresh grape leaves for 1 second in boiling water so they can bend easily. Cool them, then remove their stems and central rib. Eliminate these steps if using canned leaves. Roll the meat into the leaves and tie at 1/4-inch intervals.\nUsing a large measuring cup with a handle, remove 2/3 of the hot salt to a medium roasting pan. Arrange the meat on the bottom layer of salt and immediately cover it with the reserved salt, to cover completely. Turn the oven temperature down to 400 degrees F and roast about 25 minutes. Remove the meat from the oven when it reaches an internal temperature of 110 degrees F. Keep the meat wrapped in the leaves, and let rest 5 minutes.\nRemove all strings and leaves, slice, and serve with the caper sauce and the garnish of stuffed mushrooms.\nPrepare the mushrooms: Wash and dry the mushrooms; cut the edible part of their stems into 1/4-inch dice and set aside. Using a melon baller, remove all the foamy \"tubes\" inside the cap of each mushroom and discard them.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and sear the mushrooms 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Remove them to an ovenproof baking dish, hollow side up, and season with salt and pepper.\nAdd the onion to the same skillet and cook until translucent. Adding more oil if needed, stir in the mushroom stem dice, bread crumbs, prosciutto, parsley, basil and nuts; mixing together until well blended and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until heated throughout. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.\nSpoon an equal amount of the mixture into each mushroom cap. Drizzle more olive oil over the top of each mushroom and bake 10 to 15 minutes in the same oven as the beef.\nNote: The USDA recommends that beef be cooked to an internal temperature of 130 degrees F, but Madeleine prefers to remove the fillet from the oven when its internal temperature has reached 110 degrees. The meat continues to cook as it rests, resulting in a fillet that is rare to medium-rare.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the meat into large chunks and remove as much fat as possible. Place the meat in a large roasting pan and roast until all the juices in the pan have browned to a deep golden russet color, about 45 minutes, careful not to burn the juices.\nTransfer the meat to a large stockpot. Discard the fat in the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat and add the wine, scraping up the golden brown glaze at the bottom of the pan. Add this to the stockpot together with the 10 quarts water. Bring to a boil, add the vegetables, cloves, bouquet garni, and bouillon cubes or salt. Return to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer about 4 hours or until broth has a rich beef flavor; skimming off any scum from the surface during cooking. It may be necessary to add warm water to the pot during cooking to keep the water level approximately even throughout cooking.\nOnce the stock is finished cooking, remove from heat and allow to cool to a more manageable temperature, about 160 degrees F or higher. Strain the stock through a fine-meshed strainer either directly into storage containers or into a large bowl from which it can then be transferred into smaller storage containers. Once stock is in the storage containers, cool it down quickly by placing the containers into an ice water bath. Once cooled completely, cover and refrigerate.\nKeep containers refrigerated until all the fat has risen to the surface and hardened. To remove, break the solidified fat and discard. The stock is now ready to use. Keep refrigerated for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 6 months. To keep refrigerated stock longer, re-boil it every fourth day. Re-boil frozen stock for up to 5 minutes before using to prevent spoilage.\nYield: 10 quarts",

Work into a smooth dome completely encasing the fish. (Don't worry if the head or tail poke out a little.)\nCook approximately 35 minutes. Check for doneness by pushing the probe of an instant read thermometer through the salt into the fish. When temperature reaches 130 degrees, remove from oven, and rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Open the fish at the table by hitting the dome several times with a small hammer and lifting off the slabs of salt. Brush away any stray salt. Gently pull out dorsal (back) fin. Using a fish knife or serrated pie server, make a single incision all the way down the back of the fish and around the gill plate. Then lift the skin off working from the head to the tail. Remove meat from top side of fish, going down one side of the spine then the other. Grasp the tail and remove the skeleton, (it should come up intact). The meat revealed below will slide right off the skin.\nSprinkle meat with a little virgin oil and lemon juice. Serve immediately.",

Slide a paring knife along the inside of the bones lining the stomach flaps. Cut along the small bones running up toward the back of the salmon steak. Cut all the way to the back of the steak up to, but not through, the skin. Repeat on the other side of the steak so that the central bone is completely separated from the 2 halves of the steak. Carefully cut off 2 inches of the skin that wraps around 1 of the stomach flaps and fold the flap up in toward the center of the steak. Wrap the remaining stomach flap around the outside of the steak and tie into a round, or medallion, with string.\nHow to Poach a Small Fish in Cheesecloth:\n?h Poaching doesn't interfere with the fish's delicate flavor.\n?h It requires no fat.\n?h You can use any pan that it deeper enough to submerge the fish.\n?h Small fish can be poached on the bone or off.\nRub the inside of a boned trout with chopped fresh herbs.\nWrap the fish in a double layer of cheesecloth:\n?h Wrapping helps hold a boned fish hold its shape.\n?h Also makes it easy to pull it out of the hot liquid.\n?h If the fish is stuffed, it helps hold the stuffing in place.\nTie the cheesecloth at both ends with string.\nSlide the trout into an oval saute pan with just enough liquid to cover:\n?h The liquid should be brought to a simmer before adding fish.\n?h Check for doneness of fish after cooking for about 7 minutes per inch of thickness.\n?h Remove the skin from the fish while the fish is still hot. If you wait until the fish has cooled, it will stick.\nHow to Clean Squid:\nCut the tentacles off below the eye but be sure not to cut them too far down, or they will come apart. Fold back the tentacles slightly and push out the \"beak\" and any grit caught in the small center opening. Pull the innards out from the hood. Reach into the hood and pull out any remaining innards. Rinse out the hood. Pull out the small plastic-like \"quill\" that runs along the inside of the hood. Cut off the small fin on 1 side of the hood and cut it into strips. To remove the purple skin, start by scraping the covering off with a knife. Removing the purple skin makes the squid more attractive but less flavorful. Continue peeling the skin off with your fingers. Unless you're stuffing the hood, slice it into rings. If the tentacle bunches are large, cut them into 2 or more pieces through the top.",

  "Grape Gelee with Lemon, Basil and Crystallized Ginger Whipped Cream": {
    "instructions": "To make the gelee: Put the grapes, lemon juice, sugar and water in a medium-sized pot and set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 minutes until grapes are tender and skins have completely discolored. Using a potato masher squash the grapes to release all of the juices. Do not puree in a blender otherwise your gelee will be cloudy and pick up parts of the skin. Pour the mixture through a sieve over a large measuring cup or bowl with a spout and use the back of a ladle to firmly press the pulp - this will extract as much juice and flavor as possible. This should yield about 3 cups (24 ounces) of liquid. If it is more or less add water or pour out some of the liquid, otherwise the gelatine ratio will be off. Slowly whisk in the gelatin powder, making sure you continue to whisk until it is all fully incorporated. Divide the grape jelly mixture into 4 to 6 glasses depending on the size of your glasses. Gently agitate to remove any surface bubbles then refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours, or overnight, until set.\nTo make the salad: In a small pot, over medium heat, add the sugar, cold water, sliced lemon and ginger. Bring to a simmer, then add in the basil and shut off the heat to allow the mixture to steep, 20 minutes. Cut the grapes in half through the middle and add to a large mixing bowl. Dress the grapes with a little of the syrup and toss to combine. Discard the basil and reserve the extra syrup.\nTo make the whipped cream: Using a balloon whisk, whip the cream, sugar and vanilla until soft peaks form. Fold the ginger into the whipped cream but reserve a few pieces for garnish.\nTo assemble the dish: When the gelee is set, remove it from the refrigerator and top each glass with a spoonful of the grape salad and a quenelle of the ginger whipped cream. Garnish with basil buds and some slivers of ginger. Drizzle each glass with some of the reserved lemon-ginger syrup and serve.",

Lightly beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk about 1/4 cup of the warm corn mixture into the beaten egg yolks, then pour into the saucepan and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon, about 5 minutes.\nTransfer the hot custard to a blender and pulse until smooth (keep the filler cap slightly open to let steam escape). Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; discard the solids. Stir often until the mixture cools to room temperature. Lightly press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until cold, about 3 hours. (For faster chilling, set the bowl of custard in a bowl of ice water and stir until cold.)\nFreeze the cold custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, 2 to 3 hours.\nScoop the ice cream into bowls. Top with caramel corn or a splash of bourbon, if desired.\nPhotograph by Kang Kim",

Rinse the beans under cold water and drain.)\nWarm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small saute pan or skillet over medium heat. When it's hot, add the onion and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the onion and garlic are tender but not colored, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and, when it's incorporated evenly, add the diced tomato; pull the pan from the heat and set aside.\nPut the beans in a Dutch oven or large casserole. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Add the celery, carrots, turnips, fennel, split tomato, and the bouquet garni. Cut a parchment paper circle to fit inside the pot (see Glossary, page 369) and press the paper gently against the ingredients. Lower the heat so that the liquid bubbles at a steady simmer, and cook, stirring now and then, until the beans are tender, about 1 hour. Season the casserole with salt and pepper shortly before the beans are cooked through. When the beans are done, pull the pot from the heat and remove and discard the bouquet garni and whatever is left of the tomato. Drain the liquid from the pot into a pitcher and keep close at hand. Working gently, transfer the vegetables to a bowl.\nSpoon the beans into a baking dish--a pottery casserole would be perfect--and stir in the onion-tomato paste mixture along with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.

Reserve the remaining liquid if you are going to reheat the cassoulet. (The cassoulet can be made up to this point a day in advance, cooled, and stored tightly covered in the refrigerator. Bring it to room temperature, then reheat it for about 1 hour in a 350 degree F. oven, adding some of the reserved cooking liquid if the casserole seems dry.

Remove the seeds if you don't think your friends can handle the heat, otherwise leave'em and enjoy watching your friends shed a few extra tears. hehe... Depending on your pepper, you may have to slice around the stem of the pepper to create a manageable opening to squeeze the filling in.\nFill either a pastry bag, or your choice of tools with the filling. Use something that will allow you to sqeeze the filling into the opening of the pepper with ease. I've used a plastic frosting tool, cookie press, and even just a small spoon to squeeze the filling in. However you choose, insert a liberal amount of filling into each jalapeno. Be careful not to overfill as the filling may spurt out during cooking.\nWrap each pepper with 1 to 2 strips of bacon, securing the opening in the pepper. Secure the bacon with a toothpick (best to soak the toothpicks first, to prevent burning on the BBQ). This also helps the jalapenos from falling into the BBQ (you're bound to loose at least 1, oh well). Long metal or wood skewers also work well for large amounts.\nBBQ the peppers until they lightly roasted, or until the bacon is fully cooked.

    "instructions": "To serve the Harlequin Soup:\nLadle some of each soup into its own pitcher. Pour both soups simultaneously into each of 6 bowls, creating a swirled almost yin-yang like appearance.\nGarnish with chives and serve hot.\nCut the broccoli florets from the stems. Peel the tough outer skin from the stems and trim off the fibrous ends. Cut the stems lengthwise into slices about 1/2-inch thick and then crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces.\nHeat the olive oil and butter in a soup pot over medium-high heat until hot. Add the garlic and cook until light brown. Add the onion and celery, lower the heat to medium, and season with salt and pepper. Cook the vegetables slowly until tender, about 10 minutes. Regulate the heat so the vegetables cook without taking on color.\nAdd the thyme and stir. Add the broccoli stems, stock, and salt and pepper, to taste, and bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, for about 3 minutes. Add the florets and continue to cook until very tender, about 5 minutes more.\nPuree the soup in a blender in small batches. Add some of the spinach and some of the lemon zest to each batch and then puree it. (The soup can be made to this point, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 day or frozen for up to 1 month.)\nReturn the soup to the pan and reheat over gentle heat. Stir in the cream. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm.\nTo serve:\n1/4 cup mascarpone cheese, optional\n2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds, optional\nHeat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the onion, celery, carrot, and cinnamon stick and saute until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nAdd the chicken stock and the coriander, if using, and bring to a boil. Simmer for several minutes. Stir in the squash until smooth, then simmer gently to let the flavors meld, about 10 minutes. Discard the cinnamon stick.\nPuree the soup in a blender until smooth. (The soup can be made ahead to this point, cooled, covered, and refrigerated for several days or frozen for about 1 month. It will thicken as it cools and may need thinning with stock or water when reheating.)\nReturn the soup to the pan and reheat gently. Add the half-and-half, if using. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm until service.\nTo serve:\nLadle the soup into serving bowls. Garnish evenly, with the cheese and pumpkin seeds, if desired.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Halve lengthwise, discard the seeds, then cut into 1-inch dice. Place in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper.\nHeat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. When the butter ceases to foam and has turned a light brown, pull the pan off the heat and immediately add the sage, sugar, vinegar (stand back so as not to get splattered), molasses and toasted spice rub. Mix well and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to meld the flavors.\nPour the vinegar mixture over the squash and toss well, then transfer to a heavy rimmed baking sheet or baking dish large enough to hold the squash in a single layer. Place in the oven and roast, tossing at least once, until very tender and caramelized, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough to handle but still warm, so the liquids are runny.\nWorking in batches, if necessary, transfer the warm squash and all the cooking liquids to a food processor and process until smooth. Use immediately, refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.\nServing suggestions: Serve the puree on its own as a side dish for roast chicken, turkey, or pork; stir into polenta just before the end of cooking; use as a stuffing for ravioli; make into a soup; or use to flavor pastina. Or omit the sage, season with ground cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg to taste, and use as a substitute for canned pumpkin in your favorite pumpkin pie recipe.\nVariation for Smoky Butternut Squash: Cook the prepared squash on a baking sheet in a covered grill with soaked chips to give a slightly smoky taste. Substitute in any of the recipes that call for roasted squash. If cooking kabocha, acorn, or other difficult-to-peel squash, cut in half, scoop out the seeds, and rub the insides and cut edges with the vinegar/molasses mixture. Place on a baking sheet, cut sides up, and roast at 400 degrees F until tender. Scoop out and puree.\nToast the fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in a small, heavy pan over medium heat. When the fennel turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool.\nPut mixture into a blender with the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon and blend until the spices are evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, pepper, and chili flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dry place, or freeze.\nTaste your chili powder before adding and, if spicy and hot, cut back the amount. California chilies are almost sweet, not hot.",

  "Jezebel's Glazed Pork Chops on Pimiento Cheese Grits with Sweet Potato Frizzles": {
    "instructions": "Begin the components of this meal by beginning with the following:\nBring cola to a boil over high heat in a large wide, shallow saucepan.\nBring chicken broth to a boil over high heat in a large deep pan.\nBring 2-inches peanut oil to 350 degrees F in a large Dutch oven.\nPreparing the glaze: Once cola is boiling, continue to cook vigorously, over medium-high heat, until it's reduced to about 1/3 cup and becomes slightly syrupy, about 15 to 20 minutes. While the cola is reducing, place the peach pieces into a blender and puree. Once the cola has reduced, stir in the horseradish, peach puree, and pepper. Set aside. The glaze will have the consistency of a thin syrup.\nPreparing the grits: Once the chicken broth comes to a boil, slowly whisk in the grits and stir vigorously to avoid lumps. Continue to cook the grits over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until they are soft and thick, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cover the pot and allow the grits to sit for 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup cream, pimientos, and cheese, and stir to combine. Just before serving, check the consistency of the grits. Stir in the additional 1/4 cream, if necessary, to thin them out.\nPrepare the sweet potato frizzles: Peel and grate the sweet potato using the large holes in a box grater. Using a tea towel, squeeze as much liquid as possible from the potato. Carefully drop the dry potato shreds in the oil once it reaches 350 degrees F. Fry for about 1 minute, until crispy and lightly browned. Remove from oil, drain on paper towels, and season lightly with salt.\nPrepare the watercress salad: Grate the onion using a box grater. In a jar or shaker, mix the onion, sugar, vinegar, oil, and salt. Shake vigorously until blended. Just before plating the salad, drizzle about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the dressing over the watercress and toss gently to coat.\nPreparing the chops: (Note the chops are fully cooked, so the preparation is to give them color, glaze them, and heat them through.)\nPreheat a large grill pan to medium-high heat. Brush each chop with about a tablespoon of oil, and season scantily with salt and pepper. Be cautious about oversalting the chops, since they are generally salty. Place the chops on the grill pan. Allow to sear for about 1 to 3 minutes, and then rotate the chop to get nice hash marks on the chop for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn chops over. Cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes total. Reduce heat. A few minutes before serving, spoon about a teaspoon of glaze over each chop. Turn over and repeat, being careful not to burn the glaze.\nTo serve: Place a mound of the grits on each plate. Lean a chop next to the grits. Sprinkle about a tablespoon of sweet potato atop the grits/chop. On the side of the chop, mound a serving of the dressed watercress. Drizzle a tablespoon or so of the glaze over the chop and allow it to run into the grits.",

Roast the vegetables until tender, then remove and allow to cool.\nBegin the Marsala sauce by heating 1/4 cup of the oil in a saute pan and cooking the shallots or onion gently until translucent. Deglaze the pan with the wine and add the stock and fresh thyme. Allow to reduce by 2/3.\nFor the stuffed chicken, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay a long piece of plastic wrap over your cutting board and tuck it underneath the sides of the board. The chicken breasts should be placed on the covered cutting board, skin side down, with enough space between them so they can lay flat after you \"butterfly\" them. To make the butterfly cut, carefully slice open (without slicing the chicken all the way through) and spread the flesh of the chicken out so you will be able to pound it out into a single thin piece on which you will place stuffing and then roll up. Season the breasts with salt and pepper. Then put another length of plastic wrap over the seasoned chicken breasts and flatten with meat mallet to integrate the seasoning into the chicken. (Covering the chicken with the plastic will also keep the mess down when you pound with the meat mallet.) Pound chicken thin and remove plastic. Lay sliced smoked mozzarella on each breast followed by broccoli rabe and roasted tomatoes. Fold in each end and roll tightly, securing with toothpicks as needed, and placing on a baking sheet.

In a stainless steel bowl whisk together the 10 yolks, cornstarch and 1/4 cup of sugar. Temper the yolks by adding only a ladle of hot infused cream to the yolks. Mix well then add tempered mixture back to the saucepan. On medium heat, whisk constantly until it thickens then cook an additional 3 to 5 minutes. A pastry cream texture should be achieved. Transfer base to a baking dish, seal with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator. Base can be made 24 hours in advance.\nPre-heat a sheet tray in a 375-degree oven. Whisk the egg whites with 1-tablespoon of sugar in an upright mixer equipped with a whip attachment on slow. In about 8 to10 minutes soft peaks will be achieved. Add the rest of the sugar and whip at high speed for two 5 second bursts. In a large stainless bowl, hand whisk the chilled infused cream base until smooth. Using a spatula, gently fold in the egg whites. Work quickly, but do not over mix. The base needs to be one homogenous color. Fill ramekins to the top. Drop each one from a height of 3 inches onto the counter to disperse any unwanted bubbles. Place on heated sheet tray and bake for 12 minutes. After 6 minutes the souffles will start rising. Check the rising souffles to see if any edges are getting caught on the rims of the ramekins; if necessary open the oven door and carefully slice the sticking part with a paring knife (you won't ruin the souffles if you work fast). The souffles will straighten themselves out.

  "Three-Pound Beef Burger for Six on Country Bread": {
    "instructions": "Special equipment: Fine-mesh grill basket or all-metal strainer\nPreheat a gas grill to high or ignite the charcoal. When the grill is hot, clean your grill rack. Decrease the temperature to medium-high (for a gas grill only) and brush or wipe a little oil on the grill rack.\nDivide the ground beef into two equal portions. Line a 9-inch-round cake tin with plastic wrap. Gently push half the beef into the tin. Don't press too hard. Place another sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface and invert the tin so the shaped beef patty pops out onto the plastic wrap. Line the cake tin with plastic wrap again. Gently push the remaining half the beef into the tin and keep it in the tin for the moment.\nSprinkle the top of each patty with the salt and pepper. Spoon the cheese onto the patty still in the tin. Spread the cheese to cover the meat, but leave about 1/2-inch margin uncovered around the edge. Use the plastic wrap-lining to remove the patty from the tin and flip it onto the non-cheese patty. You want the seasoned sides of the meat facing together, with the cheese sandwiched between. Lightly press the 2 patties together all around the edge. Sprinkle the top of the burger with salt and pepper.\nWipe a pizza peel with a little oil and transfer the burger to the grill using the peel. Close the grill lid and cook until the bottom of the patty shows grill marks, 8 to 9 minutes. Spritz a little nonstick spray on top of the burger, then flip and cook, 8 to 9 minutes. Gently transfer the cooked burger to a large platter and let rest, about 15 minutes.\nHalve the bread straight across horizontally so it forms a bun. If you like, you can toast both halves lightly on the grill. Transfer the burger onto the bottom half of the bread. Spoon on the Grilled Bing Cherry-White Balsamic Sauce and close the burger with the top half of the bread. Slice the burger into 6 wedges, as if you were cutting a pizza, and serve.\nA fresh grind is just as important. Choose chuck steaks from your butchers and ask them to grind the meat while you wait, the same day you plan to cook them if possible. Even your local supermarket butcher will be happy to do this for you.\nSummer fruit, when given a quick turn on the grill, gets a smoky, sultry tang that works well with goat cheese on a burger. This also works well as a topping for a turkey burger, chicken breast or a grilled pork chop or pork loin.\nDark red Bing cherries are beautiful in this sauce but you can also use a combination of cherries with apricots, peaches or any stone fruit. I like to grill cherries and then pit them; you lose less juice that way. For stone fruit, cut the fruit in half, remove the pit, give the fruit a light rub of olive oil on both sides and then grill, about 2 minutes each side.\nPreheat a gas grill or charcoal grill to medium-hot heat. A charcoal grill will glow red under gray ash when at this temperature. (Alternatively, grill the cherries in a hot grill pan over high heat on the stove.) Pour the cherries into a fine-mesh grill basket or all-metal strainer, and place the basket over the grill. Cook until bright and smoky, but not charred, about 4 minutes. Give the basket a good shake every 20 to 30 seconds, so the cherries heat through. After 3 minutes, taste a cherry to see if it's smoky enough. Take the basket off the heat and let the cherries cool, about 5 minutes.\nHalve the cherries over a bowl, reserving all the cherry juice you can. Discard the pits. Melt the butter over medium-high heat in a large saucepan or skillet, either on the grill or the stove. When the butter is foaming, add the shallots and stir. Cook the shallots until they begin to show some color, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and brown sugar. Add the cherries to the saucepan with any reserved juice. Cook until just slightly syrupy, about 3 minutes. Add the salt and pepper, taste, and add more seasoning if you like.\nThis can be stored in the fridge, tightly covered, for 3 to 4 days. Yield: about 2 cups.",

  "Tempered Chocolate (for Use in Molding and Sculpting)": {
    "instructions": "MELTING CHOCOLATE: Chocolate melts best at temperatures between 104 and 113 degrees F (40 degrees C and 45 degrees C). Never melt chocolate directly over a heat source. Use an indirect source like a hot water bath.\nTEMPERING CHOCOLATE: Tempering determines the final gloss, hardness, and contraction of the chocolate. When you melt chocolate, the molecules of fat separate. To put them back together, you temper it. There are a variety of ways to do it. One of the easiest ways is to place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. The chocolate will not look as if it has melted because it retains its shape. It should be only slightly warmer than your bottom lip. You may still see lumps in it, but don't worry; the residual heat of the chocolate will melt them. You can also use an immersion blender to break the lumps and start the recrystallization process.\nUsually, the chocolate begins to set (recrystallize) along the side of the bowl. As it begins to crystallize, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate and they will begin recrystallization process. I like to use a glass bowl because it retains the heat and keeps the chocolate tempered for a long time.\nAnother way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, tempering is achieved by adding small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate but is usually one fourth of the total amount. I usually use an immersion blender to mix the two together.\nThe classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Chocolate is melted over hot water bath to a temperature between 88 degrees F and 90 degrees F (31 degrees C and 32 degrees C). (White and milk chocolate are melted to a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less, depending on the amount of milk fat they contain.) Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured on a cold table marble surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until the temperature of the chocolate is approximately 81 degrees F (27 degrees C). At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining one third of nontempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass in the bowl has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is further worked on the cold table until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.\nA simple method to check tempering is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been tempered correctly, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within 5 minutes.\nStoring Chocolate:\nChocolate is susceptible to moisture and absorbs external odors. It is also important to protect it from light and air. Store it in a cool, dry place in closed packaging. The ideal temperature for storing chocolate is between 54 degrees F and 68 degrees F, (12 C and 20C). Do not store chocolate in the refrigerator, where the humidity (moisture) will affect it.",

  "Coriander-Crusted Skate with Spaghetti Squash and Frizzled Brussels Sprout Leaves": {
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\nCut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Brush the halves with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and cayenne pepper. Arrange them on a sheet pan and roast them, flesh side down, until the outside of the squash can be easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven, cover with foil and keep in a warm place.\nAdd olive oil to a large saute pan until it is about 1/4-inch deep, and put over high heat. While the oil is heating, pat the skate dry with paper towels. Season the fish with salt and the ground coriander seed. When the oil is very hot but not yet smoking, dredge the skate wings in flour and shake of the excess. The fish should go IMMEDIATELY from the flour to the oil, no pausing! If all the fish will not fit in the pan at the same time, only flour the ones that will fit in the pan. Premature flouring will result in a gummy gritty skate wing. The oil should be hot and sizzling when the fish goes in. Cook each piece of fish until golden brown and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove from the oil and blot immediately on paper towels. Season with salt, to taste. If working in batches, keep the cooked fish warm in a preheated 225 degree F oven.\nWhile the fish is cooking, coat another large saute pan with olive oil, add the smashed garlic cloves and a pinch of crushed red pepper and put the pan over medium-high heat. When the garlic is golden brown and aromatic, remove it and discard. Add the Brussels sprouts to the pan and season them with salt. Saute the sprouts until they get very brown and crispy.\nUsing a large fork, scrape the flesh out of the spaghetti squash, it should look like...spaghetti! Add it to the frizzled sprouts and season again with salt.

On a floured board, stretch and roll the dough into thin discs with a rolling pin. The dough may also be stretched by hand, but rolling will give you a thinner crust.\nCoat the rolled out dough with olive oil and place, oiled side down, on a very hot grill. This can be done indoors on a cast-iron stovetop grill pan that has been preheated over medium-medium high. When you start to see bubbles on the surface of the dough, turn it over. It should be slightly browned on the bottom. Brush each round with a generous tablespoon of the garlic paste and sprinkle with the thyme. Remove from the grill with tongs and top with the Caesar salad. Grate parmesan cheese on top, fold in half, and eat.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\nPeel the outermost layers of skin off the heads of garlic. Cut off the top 1/3 of the heads to open the cloves. Save the small pieces of garlic for another use (see Chef's Note). Put the heads, cut sides up, in a small baking dish and pour the olive oil over them. Season with salt and pepper.\nCover tightly, place in the oven, and roast until about 3/4 cooked, about 45 minutes. Uncover and return to the oven until the cloves begin to pop out of their skins and brown, about 15 minutes.

You can roast the little bits from the tips of the garlic heads. Put them in a separate small baking container, such as an individual custard cup. Season with salt and pepper, douse with olive oil, cover, and place in the oven to bake along with the whole garlic heads.

  "Daniel's Sardine and Red Pepper Terrine": {
    "instructions": "Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the sardines or salmon in a single layer on the pan. Season the fillets on both sides with salt and pepper and one quarter of the olive oil. Scatter half the sage, thyme, rosemary, and garlic over the fillets and slide the pan into the oven. Roast the sardines for 7 minutes, or until they're just cooked through. Remove the sardines from the baking pan, cool, and then chill in the refrigerator. Re-line the baking sheet with clean parchment paper and arrange the eggplant on the sheet. Season the eggplant slices with salt and pepper as well as the remaining oil and herbs. Bake the eggplant for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender. Cool and then transfer to the refrigerator to chill. Line an 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 1/2-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, allowing it to extend over the sides. The terrine will be built with the eggplant, peppers, sardines, and tomatoes in layers, starting with the eggplant. To begin, cut the eggplant slices to fit the terrine and lay a layer of eggplant over the bottom and up the sides of the terrine, allow the slices to overlap a little and overhang the edges. Top with peppers, then sardines, then tomatoes. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, finishing by folding the overhanging eggplant over the top of the terrine and leveling the top with an additional layer of eggplant slices. Cover the top with the plastic wrap that's hanging over the sides and press another piece of plastic wrap against the top for good measure. Cut a piece of corrugated cardboard to fit inside the top of the terrine and press it down firmly against the plastic wrap. Place a weight, such as a 1-pound can, on top of the cardboard, put the terrine on a parchment-lined tray (to catch any drips that result from the weighting), and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, or overnight.\nTo serve: If you have an electric knife, now's the time to use it, if not, choose a long thin serrated knife and work with a sawing motion. Remove the weight, the cardboard, and the sheet of plastic wrap. Carefully cut the loaf into slices, each no less than 1-inch thick (thinner slices will fall apart.) If you'd like, serve the terrine with a small green salad dressed with lemon juice and olive oil.",

  "Bifteki Burger Sandwich": {
    "instructions": "For the tzatziki: Place the cucumber into a strainer or colander over a bowl and squeeze with your hands the shredded cucumber to release the liquid. When the liquid comes to a slow drip, set the strainer into a bowl and set the bowl in the refrigerator to continue to slowly drip for 30 minutes. Make sure the bottom of the strainer does not touch the bowl. (The purpose of straining the cucumber is important to retain the thick consistency of tzatziki sauce. You can either discard the cucumber liquid or reserve it to make a refreshing cucumber water drink.)\nEmpty the yogurt into a medium bowl. Add the strained cucumber along with the garlic, dill, vinegar and oil into the bowl and gently mix with a whisk. When all the ingredients are equally distributed, your tzatziki sauce is ready. Season with salt and pepper, if using. (Sauce can be prepared a day in advance and refrigerated.)\nFor the bifteki: In a medium bowl, add the ground beef, red onion and mint leaves. With your hands, work in all the ingredients until everything is equally distributed. Then add the crumbled cheese and mix, being careful not to overwork the mixture. You want the cheese to stay relatively chunky. Form into a loaf and cut into 6 equal pieces, about 5 ounces each. Form each piece into an oval-shaped meatball and then pat down to form an oval shaped patty. (Patties can be prepared a day in advance and refrigerated.)\nFor the sandwich: Cook each patty on a hot charcoal grill or broiler for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until desired temperature is reached. (I like this patty cooked to medium, unlike my burgers that I prefer on the rare side.)\nLightly toast the baguettes on the grill, if desired. Remove from the heat and then spread 1 tablespoon of tzatziki sauce on the top half of each baguette piece. When the patties are ready, remove from the heat and cut on a bias into 3 equal parts. Spread the cut pieces over the bottom half of the toasted baguette. Top the patty with sliced tomatoes and sliced red onions. Sprinkle some salt and pepper and Spanish smoked paprika, if using. Press both sides of the baguette together and enjoy.",

Then add eggs and milk and stir together using a metal or wooden spoon. The consistency should be a thick batter, a little thicker than pancake batter. When the water comes to a boil put a colander over the pot and pour in the batter. Using a rubber spatula, force the batter through the holes of the colander so it falls in little drops into the water. Cook for just a minute. When the spaetzle float to the surface, they are cooked. Strain and immediately rinse with cold water to cool and stop the cooking process. Lay the spaetzle out on a cookie sheet to dry a little bit.\nPork:\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\nHeat a large, oven-proof saute pan over high heat. Add canola oil and when it starts to smoke add the pork. Liberally season the pork with salt and pepper, to taste. Sear the pork on all sides to get a real good deep brown color all over the pork. Transfer the pan to the oven to finish cooking. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the pork registers 138 degrees F, about 10 to 15 minutes for medium-well. Remove the pork from the oven to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.\nSalsa: While the pork is cooking, make the salsa. In a large bowl, add the apples, the vinegar and lemon juice and toss to coat and to prevent them from turning brown. Add the jalapeno, oil, spices and salt and mix thoroughly. Stir in the cilantro, cover and refrigerate. It will keep up to 1 day.\nIn a large saute pan heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke add the spaetzle and turn the heat to medium-high. Let the spaetzle sit for a minute to get brown, then stir and brown for another minute. You are looking for nice crisp, golden brown pieces of pasta. (They shouldn't stick if you made them right. If they do stick, it means the batter was too loose from the start. If the batter was too loose just add a little more flour the next time.)\nWith a slotted spoon, remove the spaetzle from the oil and to a platter.

Turn on the mixer to medium speed and add about 1 egg white, continue adding egg white gradually until the mixture can be piped through a piping bag. You will need to adjust the amount of egg whites added to the mixture depending on the consistency of the almond paste. Place the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe the mixture onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Use any design you like when you are piping the mixture. You can place whole almonds on top of some to achieve a different design.\nPreheat the oven to 380 degrees F and bake for 8 to10 minutes, until lightly golden brown.\nPlace the sugar, honey and water in a saucepan and bring to a strong boil. Place the almonds in the food processor and grind until coarse. Remove the boiling sugar from the heat and pour over the coarse almonds. Blend until smooth. This may take 10 minutes or more, depending on the strength of the food processor. Remember, food processors are not usually strong enough to yield the same consistency as the almond paste that you can buy.

  "Turdilli": {
    "instructions": "Sift together the flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the olive oil, vermouth, and eggs until well blended. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix on low speed until the mixture forms a cohesive mass. Scrape the dough onto a very lightly floured board. Knead lightly until smooth. Shape the dough into a ball, flatten, and place in a bowl. Dust the top lightly with flour, cover with a towel or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight to allow the dough to relax.\nIf necessary, lightly dust the work surface with flour. Cut the dough into 6 or 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a rope 1/2-inch in diameter. Cut the ropes into 1/2-inch pieces. Shape into \"gnocchi\" with a gnocchi board, butter paddle, or on the back side of the tines of a fork. The deeper the grooves on the cookies the better as they puff up as they fry and the ridges, unless deep, tend to disappear.\nHeat the oil in a deep-fryer or deep pan to 350 degrees F.\nFry the cookies in about 4 batches until puffed and medium to dark brown, about 1 1/2 minutes. It is easiest to pile the cookies in a sieve or fry basket and then dip them into the hot oil. Each batch should include enough cookies to cover the surface of the oil. Any fewer and the oil gets too hot and browns the cookies before they are cooked through. Stir the cookies while they fry so they do not stick together. The number of cookies you add to the oil and the amount of oil will change the timing. The cookies first turn light gold, then a light brown, and finally almost a light milk chocolate color. Remove just as they get to this color or a little before. Drain on paper towels.\nWhile still hot, put the cookies in a large shallow dish and pour the honey over them. Toss the cookies several times as they cool. If the cookies absorb all the honey, add more - they should be fully saturated. Serve in a pretty bowl or store in a covered container. They will keep for about 1 week.\nChef's Notes: Starting with a 1/2-inch piece of dough yields a cookie about 1 inch long, perfect for popping in your mouth all at once. They can be made smaller or larger, depending on your preference. Two hundred sounds like a lot of cookies. But once you taste one you will understand why you should be thinking about making several batches in quick succession.",

We like to stop cooking the roast in the oven at 115 degrees; this is extremely rare, but the roast will continue to cook as it stands outside the oven (the temperature should go up 5 to 10 degrees).

  "Mole Negro Oaxaqueno: Oaxacan Black Mole": {
    "instructions": "In a 2 gallon stockpot, heat 5 quarts water and onions, celery, and carrots to a boil. Add chicken pieces and poach, covered, over low heat for about 35 to 45 minutes, until cooked through and juices run clear when pierced with a fork. Remove the meat from the stock. Strain and reserve the stock.\nHeat 2 quarts of water in a kettle. On a 10-inch dry comal, griddle, or in a cast-iron frying pan, toast the chiles over medium heat until blackened, but not burnt, about 10 minutes. Place the chiles in a large bowl, cover with hot water, and soak for 1/2 hour. Remove the chiles from the soaking water with tongs, placing small batches in a blender with 1/4 cup of the chile soaking water to blend smooth. Put the chile puree through a strainer to remove the skins.\nIn the same dry comal, griddle, or frying pan, grill the onion and garlic over medium heat for 10 minutes. Set aside. Toast the almonds, peanuts, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in a dry comal, griddle or cast-iron frying pan for about 5 minutes. Remove them from the pan.\nOver the same heat, toast the chile seeds, taking care to blacken but not burn them, about 20 minutes. Try to do this outside or in a well-ventilated place because the seeds will give off very strong fumes. When the seeds are completely black, light them with a match and let them burn themselves out. Remove from the heat and place in a bowl. Soak the blackened seeds in 1 cup of cold water for 10 minutes. Drain the seeds and grind them in a blender for about 2 minutes. Add the blended chile seeds to the blended chile mixture.\nHeat 3 tablespoons of oil in an 8-inch cast-iron frying pan over medium heat until smoking. Add the raisins and fry them until they are plump, approximately 1 minute. Remove from the pan. Fry the bread slice in the same oil until browned, about 5 minutes, over medium heat. Remove from pan. Fry the plantain in the same oil until it is well browned, approximately 10 minutes, over medium heat. Set aside. Fry the sesame seeds, stirring constantly over low heat, adding more oil if needed. When the sesame seeds start to brown, about 5 minutes, add the pecans and brown for 2 minutes more. Remove all from the pan, let cool, and grind finely in a spice grinder. It takes a bit of time, but this is the only way to grind the seeds and nuts finely enough.\nWipe out the frying pan and fry the tomatoes, tomatillos, thyme, and oregano over medium to high heat, allowing the juices to almost evaporate, about 15 minutes. Blend well, using 1/2 cup of reserved stock if needed to blend and set aside. Place the nuts, bread, plantains, raisins, onion, garlic and spices in the blender in small batches, and blend well, adding about 1 cup of stock to make it smooth.\nIn a heavy 4-quart stockpot, heat 2 tablespoons of lard or oil until smoking and fry the chile paste over medium to low heat, stirring constantly so it will not burn, approximately 20 minutes. When it is dry, add the tomato puree and fry until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add the ground ingredients, including the sesame seed paste, to the pot. Stir constantly with a wooden soon until well-incorporated, about 10 minutes. Add 1 cup chicken stock to the mole, stir well, and allow to cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nBreak up the chocolate and add to the pot, stirring until it is melted and incorporated into the mixture.\nToast the avocado leaf briefly over the flame if you have a gas range or in a dry frying pan and then add it to the pot. Slowly add more stock to the mole, as it will keep thickening as it cooks. Add enough salt to bring out the flavor. Let simmer another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally so it does not stick, adding stock as needed. The mole should not be thick; just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nPlace the cooked chicken pieces in the leftover stock in a saucepan and heat through.\nTo serve, place a piece of chicken in a shallow bowl and ladle 3/4 of a cup of mole sauce over to cover it completely. Serve immediately with lots of hot corn tortillas.\nYou can use oil instead of lard to fry the mole, but the flavor will change dramatically. In our pueblo, people traditionally use turkey instead of chicken, and sometimes add pieces of pork and beef to enhance the flavor. You can use leftover mole and chicken meat to make Enmoladas or Tamales Oazaquenos made with banana leaves.\nInspired by Maria Taboada and Paula Martinez",

If you are using larger potatoes, cut them into quarters, then cut those half-moons in half--the aim is to end up with uniform sized potato pieces that are one-half to no more than 3/4 of an inch on any side. Place the potato pieces into the bowl with the shallots.\n3. Pour the balsamic vinegar and the olive oil over the potatoes and shallots. Stir to mix.\n4. Remove the rosemary leaves from the stems.

Remove from heat and add the boiling chicken stock all at once. Beat vigorously with a whisk to incorporate the flour into the stock. Return to boil and add the celery. Reduce to a bare simmer, and cook for 30 minutes.\nWhen ready to serve, divide the raw oysters and the cooked asparagus tips among 6 wide, shallow soup bowls. If you find the soup too thick, add some oyster liquor to thin it. Strain the soup, bring it to a boil, add the Pernod, and turn off heat. Swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter with a whisk. Season to taste and pour immediately over the oysters and asparagus in the soup bowls, keeping the oysters just above the surface of the veloute. Garnish with fresh tarragon leaves, if available.\nAs an appetizer: The best way to use this recipe, we feel. A great start to a late-winter/early-spring dinner that leads, perhaps, into a roast leg of lamb. A wonderful way to serve it is to place the bowls before your guests, with the oysters and asparagus already set in them. Then, bring a tureen to the table and ladle the veloute over all.\nAs a main course: If you simply increase the amount of oysters and asparagus-say 8 per person rather than 4-you'll have a light but filling main-course soup.

  "Pizza with Rosemary and Garlic (Pizza Bianca)": {
    "instructions": "Special equipment: large bread bowl, 12 by 18-inch baking sheet or two smaller sheets\nPlace water in a large bowl. Water should be warm but not hot to the touch. Stir in the yeast and allow to dissolve. Stir in 1 cup flour, stirring constantly in the same direction. Stir in another cup flour, then stir 100 times in the same direction (one minute). This helps develop the gluten. You now have a sponge. Cover, and let stand for half an hour or up to three hours. When you are ready to continue, sprinkle on salt and oil, then add more flour, stirring it in a half cup at a time. The dough will be getting heavier and harder to stir. When you can stir no longer, flour a kneading surface well and have more flour handy beside your work surface. Turn dough out and knead, adding extra flour to your work surface as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. The dough will gradually become smooth and easy to work. Knead for 10 minutes, clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, and place the ball of dough into the bowl to rise, covered with plastic wrap. Let rise until more than doubled, almost three hours. When the volume of the dough has approximately doubled, you can proceed to the next step.\nDough can be made ahead to this point and then stored. If you wish postpone baking, gently push dough down, and leave covered in the bowl to rise again. If delay will be more than several hours, instead store dough in a plastic bag in the refrigerator (for not more than five days). Bring out of the cold and take out of the plastic bag at least an hour before you want to work with it.Lightly flour your work surface and lightly oil a 12 by 18-inch baking sheet. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Turn dough out onto work surface and flatten with the lightly floured palm of your hand. Pull and stretch the dough gently out into the rectangular shape you need to fit your baking sheet. Take your time and give the dough time to rest if it is resisting stretching. It will need to get quite thin. When you have stretched the dough to approximately the shape and size you need, transfer it to baking sheet and continue to gently press and stretch it to fit. Don't worry if it tears, just patch the hole with another piece of dough and press firmly to join the edges. If you have extra dough hanging over the edge, trim it off and use it to make another small pizza. Dough should be of an even thinness across the flat part of the baking sheet and should form a slight rounded rim as it meets the edge (which is for many people the best part of the pizza).\nBrush top of pizza with oil, then dimple the surface all over with your fingers. Sprinkle garlic, sea salt and then optional rosemary leaves. Place baking sheet on the bottom rack of the preheated oven and bake until the crust around the edge is slightly golden, 5 to 8 minutes, depending on how thin the pizza is. Remove from oven, brush crusts lightly with olive oil and also the center if you wish. Cut into large squares and serve warm or hot. We have often made pizza bianca several hours ahead, then wrapped it in a clean kitchen towel to keep it moist until we are ready to reheat it for serving. To reheat, place in a dampened paper bag in a 300 degree F oven for about 10 minutes.",

Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula until the mixture comes to a simmer and is thick like pudding, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter until melted. Strain the filling through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pushing it through with a rubber spatula. Press plastic wrap onto the surface of the filling and refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours.\nMeanwhile, make the crepe batter: Combine the flour, eggs, milk, melted butter, granulated sugar, vanilla and salt in a blender; blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed. Set aside, covered, 1 hour. (This prevents the crepes from turning out rubbery.)\nFinish the filling: Beat the heavy cream in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until it starts thickening, about 1 minute. Add the confectioners' sugar and beat until stiff peaks form, about 1 more minute. Beat in the vanilla. Stir one-quarter of the whipped cream into the orange filling, then gently fold in the rest. Cover and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.\nMake the crepes: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lightly brush with butter, then pour 1/4 cup batter into the center of the pan. Quickly tilt and swirl the pan to coat and cook until the bottom is golden brown and the top is firm, about 1 minute. Loosen the edges of the crepe with a spatula, then flip with your fingers; cook until lightly browned on the other side, 30 more seconds. Invert onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the crepes as you go; lightly brush the pan with more butter as needed. You will have about 16 crepes. (Don't worry if a few tear-layer them in the middle of your cake.)\nPut 1 crepe on a platter and top with a scant 1/4 cup filling, spreading it to the edge.

  "Aloo Samosas": {
    "instructions": "Filling:\nTo make the dough: Whisk together the flour, ajawain, if using, and the salt. Add the oil and, using your hands, rub it into the flour mixture until fully incorporated. While stirring with a wooden spoon, gradually add the water, until a dough is formed. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until soft and pliable, about 3 minutes. Rub a little oil over the dough and cover with a damp towel. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, make the filling: Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with cold tap water by about 2 inches, and season with salt. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool slightly. Using a fork, slightly smash the potatoes.\nMeanwhile, in a small food processor (mini-chopper), combine the onion, ginger, garlic, chile, and 1 tablespoon water and puree to a paste.\nHeat the ghee in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mustard, cumin, and fennel seeds and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the onion paste, salt, garam masala, and turmeric and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring and mashing lightly with a wooden spoon, until hot, about 2 minutes. Stir in the peas. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons water.\nTo form the samosas: Divide the dough into 7 portions. Using your hands, roll each portion into a small ball. On a floured work surface, using rolling pin, roll each ball into a 7-inch wide disc. Cut each disc in half.\nSet a small bowl of water beside you. Working with one dough semi-circle at a time, fold half of the straight edge up to the rounded side and wet its outside edge with a little water. Fold the other half up to form a cone, overlapping it with the other side by 1/4 inch. Press the edges together to form a seal. Hold the cone in one hand and fill it with about 1/4 cup of the potato filling. Slightly wet the inside of the rounded edge and fold it over the filling to enclose it. Press the edges together to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling to make 14 samosas.\nThere are two choices at this point. For samosas with a slightly blistered and bubbly crust, store them uncovered in the refrigerator overnight and fry them the next day (the dough becomes soft and moist, creating small puffs in the dough when fried); or continue to the next step and fry them right away for an equally good but smooth crust.\nIn a large, wide heavy-bottomed pot, pour in the oil to a depth of about 2 inches. Place over medium heat, and heat until a deep-fry thermometer inserted in the oil registers 365 degrees F.\nWorking in small batches, fry the samosas until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Serve immediately with tamarind sauce or your favorite chutney.\nGhee:\nMelt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Lower the heat and simmer until all of the water has evaporated and the white milk solids have browned in the bottom of the saucepan, about 8 minutes.\nPour the ghee into a large container, leaving the browned milk solids in the pan. Use now or store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nYield: about 2 cups",

Reduce the heat and continue cooking over moderately low heat for about 15 minutes. Add the wine and stir to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom and sides of the pan. Add the chicken broth. Bring to the boil and let cook over high heat for about 5 minutes. Remove the strings and serve the veal rolls with the sauce spooned over.",

  "Chicken-Fried Steak with Spiced Milk Gravy": {
    "instructions": "For the marinade: Soak the tenderized steaks in the buttermilk for 1 hour or up to overnight. This will help tenderize the meat. For the spiced milk gravy: Like any good gravy, we are starting out with a simple roux of equal parts butter and flour. Melt the butter in a medium saucepot over medium heat, then whisk in the flour. Cook the flour and butter until it's a light blond color (just enough to cook the raw taste out), about 2 minutes, and then whisk in the broth and milk. Bring the gravy to a simmer and cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add in the Worcestershire sauce, peppercorns, brine, hot sauce and salt to taste and bring back to a simmer. Check for seasoning and set aside until ready to use. For the chicken-fried steaks: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Add the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, baking soda, cayenne and onion powder to a shallow baking dish. Remove the steaks from the buttermilk and place each steak in the flour mixture, coating all of the sides and shaking off the excess. Next, dip the steaks back into the buttermilk, coating them on all sides and allowing the excess to drip off. Return to the flour mixture once again, shaking off the excess. Reserve the flour mixture for dredging the steak a third time for an extra-crispy crust after resting. Let the steaks sit on a wire rack in the fridge 30 minutes (this will help the coating to really adhere to the chicken-fried steak). Then re-dredge in the seasoned flour just before frying. Heat 1-inch vegetable oil in large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F. Working in batches of two at a time, place the steaks in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, using tongs to turn once, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat the process with all the steaks. Transfer the chicken-fried steaks to individual plates. Spoon the Spiced Milk Gravy over the steak and serve immediately.",

With a fine grater or zester, zest the skin of 1 lime over the onions. Cut the 4 whole limes in half cross wise and squeeze the juice over the onions. Add a pinch of salt and mix. Submerge the onions in the juice; use the squeezed limes as a weight to push down any onions sticking out of the juice. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate. Marinate the onions in the juice for as long as possible, at least 15 minutes or up to 3 days.\nPour the oil into a large heavy pot that has at least a 6-quart capacity. (There should be at least 2 inches of oil in the pot.) Clip a deep-frying thermometer to the side of the pot and be sure the thermometer is touching the bottom of the pot. Heat the oil to 400 degrees F over medium heat (do not ever cover the pot).\nPlace a chicken thigh on a cutting board and cut into 4 to 5 even-sized chunks. Repeat until all thighs are cut into chunks. Arrange all the chunks on a microwave-safe plate and season both sides with 1/4 tablespoon of adobo powder, as well as pepper. Place the plate in the microwave and cook on high for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Remove the plate and turn each piece of chicken over. Microwave again on high until the chunks are just cooked through, another 1 to 2 minutes, depending on your microwave. Let the chicken cool to room temperature.\nPut the egg whites in a bowl and beat with a fork until just foamy, about 1 minute. In a separate wide and shallow bowl or cake pan, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of adobo powder and paprika with the cornmeal and whole-wheat flour. Mix thoroughly.

One at a time, lift the chicken pieces from the egg whites, transfer them to the flour mixture, and coat each piece thoroughly. Let the chicken sit in one layer over the flour mixture. Wash and dry your hands thoroughly prior to assembling the salad.\nPlace the iceberg chunks in a bowl and add the cherry tomatoes. Drain the lime juice from the onions and reserve. To the salad, add the onions, a dash of salt, and 2 tablespoons of the reserved lime juice. Toss to dress evenly. Divide the salad among four serving plates. Divide the avocado pieces equally among the salads.\nFry the chicken in the oil in four separate batches until deep golden brown, about 12 seconds. Using metal tongs or a stainless steel spider basket, remove the chicken pieces from the oil and transfer them to a plate with either a wire rack on top or paper towels to drain off any excess oil.

  "Pork Loin, Sauerkraut and Dumplings": {
    "instructions": "TO PREPARE THE PORK LOIN:\nIn a pressure cooker on high heat, brown pork in oil on all sides to sear in juices. Season with salt and pepper. Then add water or broth to pan (enough so there's about 1 1/2 inches in the bottom of the cooker). The amount of liquid depends on the size of your roast-for 3 pounds use 1 1/2 inches of liquid -- add 1/2-inch more per each pound. Pressure cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours so pork is extremely tender and falls apart. (This is important to the dish). When pork is done, remove from pot and keep the meat juice to serve on pork and dumplings. Prep time on this is about 15 minutes to get a good, rich searing. Pressure cooking time is about 1 1/2 to 2 hours depending on how tender you want your meat.\nOven method: Pierce pork with a knife, slice 3 cloves of garlic and insert in different spots of roast. Season with salt and pepper. In a heavy cast iron pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and on high heat, brown pork to sear in juices. Add 2 cups beef broth and 1/4 cup vermouth (this will also deglaze the pan) and cover the pot with lid. Place in a preheated 350 degree oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, and frequently baste with pan juices. Be sure to periodically check your roast, as you want the roast to be pink and juicy inside, not dry and gray. After the pork is done, remove from pan and save the meat juices Combine 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 1/4 cup cold water. Slowly add cornstarch mixture to thicken the juices for passing and to serve over pork and dumplings. This gives the juices a richer, heartier flavor that sticks to the pork and dumplings, unlike the traditional thinner juices to pass; however, Grandma and Grandpa always preferred the traditional thinner juice. Prep time on this is again, about 15 minutes to get a good searing, and cooking time anywhere from 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. While your meat is cooking, you can prepare the dumplings.\nPOTATO DUMPLINGS:\nCombine dumpling ingredients well. Put out on floured bread board and knead more flour in until stiff-like bread dough and it isn't sticky to your hands. Break off small pieces and form into flat balls, drop into rapidly boiling water. Bring back to a boil and cook 10 to 15 minutes. Cut 1 and if it isn't sticky inside, they are done.\nNOTE: If you have more people - say 8 - mix potatoes for 8 and add more flour; for 10 or more, add 3 eggs and more flour.\nPrep time--10 to 20 minutes depending on how much kneading you have to do to get the dough not sticky.\nCooking time - about 20 to 25 minutes or until the dumplings aren't doughy and sticky on the inside.\nSAUERKRAUT:\nIn a heavy bottomed pot, heat olive oil and then add onion; cook until transparent. Then add sauerkraut and caraway seed, salt (not much) pepper, beef bouillon, and vermouth, to taste. Let this simmer for about 30 to 45 minutes, until the flavor is all the way through the sauerkraut. Serve along side the pork.\nPrep time about 10 minutes.\nCooking time about 45 minutes or until you taste the flavor through the sauerkraut.\nTo serve, which was usually done homestyle, you place some pork, a dumpling (cut it up into hearty, bit size pieces), and some sauerkraut on the plate. Then pass, and spoon or drizzle some of the meat juices you saved, either thick or thin, over your pork and dumpling....this ties everything all together, and you get a forkful of flavor in each bite.\nThere you have it, hearty, stick to your ribs pork, dumplings and sauerkraut; an excellent dish on a cold, frosty night!",

Drain the parsnips, saving the milk.\nPut the parsnips in a food processor with the honey and puree. Add some milk to adjust the consistency (you'll need 1 to 2 cups of the liquid). Season with salt and pepper.\nFor the roasted tomatoes: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.\nCut the ends off of each tomato and then cut each tomato into 3 slices. In a bowl, toss the tomato slices with the oil, salt and pepper. Arrange the tomato slices on a baking sheet and roast until tender and the edges are brown, 10 to 15 minutes.\nFor the asparagus: Add 1 gallon of water and 2 tablespoons kosher salt to a large pot and bring to a rolling boil. Set up an ice bath for shocking the asparagus after blanching.\nBlanch the Asparagus in batches in the boiling water for 45 seconds to a minute, and then transfer to the ice bath. Dry off the asparagus with a towel and set aside.\nFor the steak: Heat a skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Depending on the size of the skillet (and how many batches you'll cook), add 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons grapeseed oil.\nSalt and pepper the steaks and sear on each side (the teres major is a triangle shape) for 3 to 4 minutes. Once all of the steaks are cooked, put them all into a pan and add the butter. Allow the steaks to rest for 10 minutes, basting with the butter occasionally.\nTo finish the asparagus, heat a saute pan over high heat, add the grapeseed oil and saute the asparagus for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nFor plating: Divide the parsnip puree among 6 plates and drag it from one side of the plate to the other. Shingle 3 slices of tomato across the parsnip puree. Slice each steak into 5 slices and shingle over the top of the tomatoes. Pour 2 to 3 ounces of the Demi-Glace over and around each plate. Lean 5 pieces of asparagus up on the side of each steak.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees F.\nPour the oil into a metal roasting pan and put it in the preheated oven for 3 to 5 minutes to heat up the pan and condition it with the oil. Spread the bones out on the roasting pan and cook until browned, 30 to 45 minutes, turning the bones occasionally so they brown evenly.\nTransfer the bones to a large-enough stockpot to accommodate the bones, 6 quarts ice water and more. Use tongs to transfer the bones so you do not pour any fat into the stockpot. Add the ice water to the stockpot and bring to a simmer. Allow the stock to cook for 4 hours at a slow simmer. Skim the surface of the stock occasionally to remove any fat or impurities.\nWhile the stock is simmering, discard all but about 1/4 cup of the fat from the roasting pan. Bring the pan back up to temperature over high heat on the stovetop. Add the onions and carrots and cook until golden brown and caramelized. Add the celery and cook for another 10 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, thyme and bay leaf and cook, stirring regularly, until the tomato paste gets a brick red color, about 15 minutes. Add 1 cup of the red wine and stir it into the mirepoix (vegetable) mixture.\nAdd the mirepoix mixture to the stock after the 4-hour simmering time. Bring the stock back up to a simmer and continue to cook it for another 2 hours.\nIn a separate pot, bring the remaining 7 cups red wine to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes.\nWhen the stock has simmered for 6 hours, strain it through a chinois and combine the strained stock with the reduced red wine. Bring the stock to a boil, lower the heat to a hard simmer and reduce the stock until it has a consistency that coats the back of spoon and is about 2 quarts (8 cups) in volume, up to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper and then strain the sauce though a chinois again.",

At Craftsman and Wolves, we like to use fresh seasonal vegetables in our frittata. However, the wonderful thing about this dish is you can use whatever is in your fridge. Start by either sauteing or roasting your vegetables. If you are sauteing, you can use the same pan to cook the frittata. If you have leftover vegetables, make sure to thoroughly warm them in your frittata pan before adding the egg mixture. This will keep the vegetables from sticking to the bottom of the pan when you serve the frittata. Once your vegetables are cooked, set a 9-inch pan over medium-high heat. Evenly coat the canola oil around the sides and bottom of your pan. When the oil starts to smoke a little, turn down the heat to medium and add your vegetables so that they form a even layer on the bottom of your pan. After 1 minute, add your frittata mixture. It should sizzle up the side of the pan. Turn your heat down to medium-low and let the frittata cook. Once the edges of the frittata are set, transfer to the oven and cook just until the center is set, 16 to 20 minutes. Allow the frittata to cool for 5 minutes, and then run a butter knife around the side to loosen it from the pan. Invert onto a cutting board and cool 10 minutes.

In a wok, or heated saute pan, add tablespoon of oil and saute mixture until 3/4 cooked, on high heat about 3 to 4 minutes, tossing mixture around in pan constantly.\nPrepare work area. Clean a surface and place bowl of water with cornflour mixed in, damp towel, spring roll wrappers, and partially cooked turkey mixture in work area. Start wrapping spring rolls by placing one wrapper at a time down on flat surface in at a diamond angle to you. Fill about 2 tablespoons of mixture starting a little above the bottom point of the wrapper. Dip fingers in the water bowl and moisten the top and sides of the wrapper. Start at the bottom tip and fold wrapper over turkey mix, rolling the mix into the wrapper half way. Then fold sides inward and continue rolling, sealing with more water if necessary on top. Continue to fold one at a time, keeping the finished ones moist under the moist clean towel (the towel should not be dripping wet, just moist to the touch).\nTime to Fry! In a deep frying pot, fill halfway with corn or vegetable oil. Heat until when wood chopsticks are placed in to touch the bottom, there are fast streams of bubbles streaming to the top (yes, that's the way my mother taught me!). Very important: before placing spring rolls in oil, make sure they are dry on the outside (if your towel was too damp, you must dry off the rolls in paper towel first, otherwise the oil will pop). Place spring rolls in a few at a time making sure to keep them separated while frying. If the oil is too hot, the outside will cook too quickly, leaving the inside undercooked -- adjust the temperature so that each spring roll takes about 5 to 7 minutes each to cook through and are golden brown. Drain and serve immediately.\nExcellent when served with your favorite dipping sauce. Try a sweeter sauce with spring rolls such as a plum or duck sauce.",

Crush the peppercorns with a mortar and pestle (or in a spice-devoted coffee grinder) to a medium-coarse texture. (Some will be finely ground, but you want the larger pieces to resemble cracked pepper.) Rub the pepper into the meat, saving what doesn't stick for the marinade.\nHeat a small saucepan over medium-low heat, and add the butter and garlic. Cook until the butter bubbles; add the vinegar, thyme and remaining black pepper, and remove from the heat.\nSprinkle the pork with 1 teaspoon salt. Heat an ovenproof skillet large enough to fit the pork roast over high heat and add the oil. Brown the meat quickly on all sides.\nBrush the meat generously with some of the pepper mixture, put the skillet in the oven and roast for 10 minutes.

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a food processor, fitted with a metal blade, combine the almonds and brown sugar. Process until completely ground. Using an electric mixer, fitted with a whip attachment, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar on low speed until frothy. Add 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue whipping until very stiff peaks and the whites just begin to slip and streak around the side of the bowl. Remove the bowl from the mixture and fold in the almond and sugar mixture. When almost completely incorporated, add the 2 teaspoons of coffee and continue folding until mixed. The batter must be smooth an shiny, and it should spread easily without being runny. If it is dull and firm, fold it a little longer to deflate it slightly and get the required consistency. But do not deflate it too much or the batter with spread too much and the tops of the cookies will crack when baked. Fill a large pastry bag, fitted with a 3/4 inch plain pastry tube, with the batter. Line two half sheet pans with parchment paper. Pipe the domes in staggering rows 1 inch wide and 1 inch apart. Unless you have 2 ovens, pipe only 1 sheet of cookies at a time. Bake for 1 minute. Place an empty baking sheet underneath the sheet of cookies, and continue baking, using a wooden spatula to hold the oven door ajar, until the tops of the cookies are very lightly browned and dry to the touch white the insides are still soft and the bottoms still pale, about 8 to 10 minutes. Lift the baking sheet of cookies off the empty baking sheet and take it to the sink. Pour cold water, about 1/2 cup, between the paper and the baking sheet (tilting the baking sheet so that the water runs over the entire surface and drains thoroughly into the sink) to steam the cookies off the paper. Then place the baking sheet on a wire rack and cool. Spread the bottoms of half the cookies with some of the Ganache. Place the remaining cookies, right side up, on top of the Ganache, pressing slightly to form a sandwich. Place the filled macaroons on a serving plate.\nChop the chocolate and put it in a small stainless steel bowl. Bring the cream just to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly with a wire whisk.

  "Fish Consomme with Shrimp Dumplings and Edamame": {
    "instructions": "To make the \"white\" mirepoix, mix the onion, lemon grass, celery, and leek and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. (In combination with the fish and egg whites, the mirepoix will form the clarification to make the consomme crystal clear. This combination of ingredients will form what is referred to as a raft that essentially coagulates as the consomme clarifies.) Mix the chilled mirepoix, ginger root, fish scraps, shrimp shells, and egg white and add to a stockpot. Pour in the chilled fish stock. Add the lemon juice. Bring to a simmer (just below a boil in classical cooking) over low heat, stirring frequently so that the clarification ingredients remain free floating. Please note that the heat must be kept at a simmer, low enough so that the raft which is forming does not break apart from the action of cooking and high enough to cook out the impurities so that they can be collected in the raft. Once the raft forms and rises to the surface, cease stirring. However, gather some broth from the edge of the pot and baste the raft to keep it from breaking apart. After 60 to 90 minutes at the correct simmer, the raft will begin to sink, at which point the consomme is finished.\nFor the edamame, add soybeans in their pods to a pot and cover with water. Boil until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove soybeans from their pods and set aside until needed.\nIn a food processor blend shrimp, egg whites, scallions, salt and pepper to a paste.

Lower the heat, and cook uncovered at a full simmer for 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the little bubbles to be throughout the pot, not just at the edges. After 45 minutes, refrigerate a small amount of the liquid to see if it becomes syrupy. It should be like a soft fruit preserve. Keep cooking just until the liquid starts to gel when cold. If the liquid is too firm, add a little orange juice or water, cook for a minute, and test it again until it's right. Depending on how ripe the figs are, they will probably keep their shape, but it's fine if they don't. Discard the vanilla bean and serve or refrigerate.",

Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour and egg yolks (the mixture will be thick). Pour the milk mixture into the bowl, whisking until smooth. Return the mixture to the saucepan and whisk slowly and constantly over medium-low heat until smooth and thick, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter. Whisk in the lemon juice and vanilla until smooth. Transfer the custard to a clean bowl and lay a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface.

Boil, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, 3 to 4 minutes. Let the syrup cool for 1 minute. While the sugar mixture is cooking, in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to high and beat until the egg whites hold soft peaks. Reduce the speed to low and carefully drizzle the hot syrup down the side of the mixing bowl. Beat at high speed until the egg whites hold stiff, glossy peaks, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in the lemon juice.\nFold the custard into the meringue, then spoon into serving bowls or cups.

On low speed, add the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, and then add the lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt.

  "Eggnog-Chocolate Cake Roll": {
    "instructions": "Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil and line with parchment paper. Brush the parchment with oil and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the flour, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, the malted milk powder, cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the egg whites in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar; continue beating until stiff shiny peaks form. Set aside.\nBeat the vegetable oil, egg yolks and milk in a separate bowl with the mixer on medium speed (no need to clean the beaters). Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the batter, then fold in the rest until incorporated. Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan and springs back when lightly pressed, 12 to 14 minutes. Dust the cake with the confectioners' sugar and spread a large clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) on top. Invert a cooling rack onto the towel, then invert the cake onto the rack; peel off the parchment. Roll up the cake and towel together, starting from a long side to form a 17-inch-long roll. (You'll remove the towel later.) Set aside on the rack to cool completely.\nMake the frosting: Combine the granulated sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. (Brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush.) When the sugar has almost reached 240 degrees F, beat the egg and egg yolks in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment on high speed until thick and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour in the sugar syrup between the whisk and the side of the bowl. Increase the speed to high and beat until the bowl is cool to the touch. Remove the whisk and fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on medium-high speed, gradually add the butter and beat until thick and glossy. Combine the malted milk powder, vanilla and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl; beat into the frosting along with the nutmeg.\nUnroll the cooled cake and spread with 1 1/2 cups of the frosting. Gently reroll the cake (without the towel) and trim the ends. Cover with the remaining frosting; dust with cocoa powder.\nPhotograph by Johnny Miller",
